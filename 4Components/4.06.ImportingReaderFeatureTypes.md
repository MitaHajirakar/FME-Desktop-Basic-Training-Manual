### Importing Reader Feature Types ###
A further tool under the Reader menu is labelled Import Feature Types.

To understand importing feature types, it’s important to recognize that a dataset is made up two parts. One part of a dataset is obviously the data itself, but another - separate - part is the dataset schema.

What the import tool does is read the schema of a dataset (not the data) and use it as the template for a set of feature types in a workspace.

One reason to import feature types is to read extra tables from a database, or when a source dataset itself is updated. For example, a user has a workspace reading from a spatial database. It only needs to read from a single table (roads), so there is a single Reader representing the database, and a single Feature Type representing the table.

However, at some future point the user decides the workspace also needs to read from a second table (‘rail’).

The simplest solution is to use the command Readers>Import Feature Types...

The import tool will take the schema definition of the database table ‘rail’ and add it to the workspace.

The same process could be used on a file-based dataset when, for example, the dataset was created with just a 'roads' layer, but was later updated to include a 'rail' layer. In that case the FME user would import that layer to ensure the data is read.
