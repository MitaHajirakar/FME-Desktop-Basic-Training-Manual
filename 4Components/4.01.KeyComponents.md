# Key Components #
The list of key components in an FME translation is as follows:

- Workspace
- Readers and Writers
- Feature Types
- Features

This section covers “official” FME components only. For example, it won’t cover any user-defined Python scripting that might be used to exert control over several workspaces.
<br>However, once you understand the structure, it’s easy to imagine where such custom components might fit it.

## Workspace ##
A workspace is the primary element in an FME translation and is responsible for storing a translation definition. A workspace is held as a file with an .fmw file extension. It can be run in either the Quick Translator or FME Workbench, but can only be opened for editing in Workbench.

Think of a workspace as the container for all the functionality of a translation.


## Readers and Writers ##
A Reader is the FME term for the component in a translation that reads a source dataset. Likewise, a Writer is the component that writes to a destination dataset. 

We'll see that Readers and Writers don’t appear as objects on the Workbench canvas, but instead are represented by entries in the Navigator window.


## Feature Types ##
Feature Type is the FME term that describes a subset of records. Common alternatives for this term are 'layer,' 'table,' 'sheet,' 'feature class,' and 'object class.' For example, each layer in a DWG file is defined by a feature type in FME.

Feature Types are the brown-colored objects that appear on the Workbench canvas.

Don’t confuse the term Feature Type with Geometry Type.
<br>Feature Type means “layer;” Geometry Type means “lines,” “points,” “polygons.”

## Features ##
Features are the smallest single components of an FME translation.

They aren’t individually represented within a workspace, except by the feature counts on a completed translation.
