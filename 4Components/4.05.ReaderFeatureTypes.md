## Reader Feature Types ##


#Copied content
Feature Types are represented by objects in the Workbench canvas. The important part here is that each feature type belongs to a Reader or Writer defined in the Navigator window.

Therefore, when reading data, the Navigator window defines what dataset is being read, and the canvas objects define what layers are being read from that data. If a specific layer is not defined by a feature type, then that data will not be either read and/or written.



In this workspace, a Reader is reading a source dataset of roads, with a different layer for each road type.Notice the Reader in the Navigator window and how it has a list of feature types; then notice that each of these feature types is also depicted on the canvas:

In this workspace there are two Readers (one Esri Shape, one File Geodatabase). Each Reader has three different feature types.

Notice - and this is where is can be confusing - there is no visible connection between the Reader and its feature types, nor is it certain that feature types on the canvas will be organized in this way (though for Best Practice purposes they should be!)

***Reader Feature Types*** are objects on the Workbench canvas that define the schema of the data being read. Most importantly, they define two specific things: they define the layers being read from a source dataset and the attributes that those layers possess.


### Adding Reader Feature Types ###
As we have already seen, the Reader schema defines “what we have” as source data. So if you want to read data from a particular layer, in a particular dataset, then it's not enough to just select that dataset; you also have to ensure that the layer is defined as a feature type in the canvas.

Usually, defining these feature types is done when the workspace is generated or the Reader is being added.

For a file-based dataset, like an AutoCAD file, FME scans the dataset to find what layers exist and then prompts the user which should be added:

For a folder-based dataset, like Esri Shape, the user should just select the files that represent the feature types:

For a database, like PostGIS, the user should click the parameters button and use the Tables to Read parameter:

Note that it’s not necessary to select all feature types that exist in a dataset. If you don’t want to read a particular layer of data, don’t select it. This way the feature types that you need to be read are all represented on the canvas, and feature types you don’t need are not.


### Feature Type Attributes ###
Reader feature types contain a definition for the attributes that belong to it:

Notice that the attribute types relate to the format being read, and are not a generic FME representation. Also notice that, because the Reader feature types represent “what we have”, the attribute definitions are greyed-out and cannot be edited.

######***TIP***
*Under Tools > FME Options > Workbench there is a setting where you can turn on Reader feature type editing. One scenario where you might want to do so is this: You have a client. His name is Bond. James Bond. He wants you to create a workspace for him that reads a top-secret database. He cannot let you connect to the database, but he will tell you the schema. In that case you can create his workspace manually by turning on this option.*


### Removing Feature Types ###
The remove feature types tool is found on the menubar, and simply removes one or more feature types from the Reader.

Another way to do this is to select the feature type on the canvas and press the keyboard delete key.

For example, if there is a source dataset layer that the user wishes to no longer read, then they would delete the matching feature type from the workspace.

Whenever all feature types are deleted from a Reader then FME will prompt the user to decide whether to remove the Reader component as well.

This makes sense because if there are no feature types you wish to keep, why would you still wish to read the dataset at all?

If you answer No, then the feature types are all removed, but the Reader is left in the translation. We call this a "dangling” Reader because it has no children in the hierarchy.

######***TIP***
*A dangling Reader isn’t a problem provided it’s only a temporary situation; i.e. the user intends to now add new feature types.*

*The workspace should not be run in this condition!*

*Performance suffers because all the source data is still being read, yet discarded immediately.*
