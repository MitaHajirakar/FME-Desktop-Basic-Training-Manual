### Adding Feature Types ###
Having looked at attribute definitions, now let's look at how to manage the feature type objects themselves.

As we have already seen, the Writer schema defines "what we want" as a destination dataset. So if you want to write data to a particular layer, in a particular dataset, then you have to ensure that the layer is defined as a feature type in the canvas.

In some cases this happens automatically. When you generate a workspace the source dataset(s) you choose are scanned and all of the layers within get matching feature type objects in the workspace - both on the Reader and the Writer.

######TIP
*When FME adds Writer feature types as part of a new workspace, those feature types will get a fixed (manual) attribute definition that is taken from the selected source dataset. These attributes can then be manually edited, as demonstrated in the chapter on Data Transformation.*

However, in most cases you need to manage Writer feature types separately, because "what you want" is not the same as "what you have". For example, perhaps you want to divide an incoming layer of data into two layers in the output dataset (in which case you will need to add a new Writer feature type).

Adding a Writer feature type manually has this effect on the hierarchy diagram. Your output was designed to have only a single layer; now it will have two.

### Adding Feature Types to an Existing Writer ###
Feature Types can be added manually to a writer using Writers>Add Feature Type on the menubar.

######TIP
*At least one writer must exist in the translation hierarchy; else this option will be greyed out.*

Choosing to add a feature type adds one to the translation, and then causes the Feature Type Properties dialog to appear in order to edit the feature type properties.

As when editing the schema, the General tab can be used to define the new feature type’s name.

######TIP
*Remember, with format-specific terminology, instead of "Feature Type" this dialog's labels may state "Feature Class," "Layer," "Sheet," or whatever terminology is specific to the format of data you are writing.*

As usual, the User Attributes tab can be used to define the new feature type’s attribute schema.

### Adding Feature Types to a New Writer ###
When a new Writer is being created the option is provided to add new feature types:

Addition of feature types can be completed in a number of ways:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img4.64.AddWriterFTOptions.jpg)

- Automatic: Adds a new feature type with the attribute definition parameter set to automatic
- Manual: Adds a new feature type with the attribute definition parameter set to manual
- Copy from Reader: Adds a new feature type with the attribute definition parameter set to manual, but pre-defined to the schema of an existing Reader feature type
- Import from Dataset: Adds a new feature type with the attribute definition parameter set to manual, but pre-defined to the schema of an external dataset (just like using the Import Feature Types tool)
- Dynamic: Adds a new feature type with the attribute definition parameter set to dynamic
- None: Does not add any new feature type


### Copying Feature Types to a Writer ###
When adding a Writer it's possible to create a new feature type whose attribute schema is pre-defined to that of an existing Reader. However, if you already have a Writer, you can still carry out the same procedure of copying a Reader schema. This is simply done by selecting the required Reader feature types, right-clicking them, and using the option Duplicate (on Writer).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img4.65.DuplicateFTOnWriter.jpg)

The command causes duplicates of the Reader feature types to be added to the writer, and source/destination feature types to be automatically connected.

Again, at least one writer must exist in the translation hierarchy; else this option will be greyed out.


### Removing Feature Types ###
The remove feature types tool is found on the menubar, and simply removes one or more feature types from the Writer.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img4.66.RemoveFeatureTypesMenubar.jpg)

Another way to do this is to select the feature type on the canvas and press the keyboard delete key.

For example, if there is a destination dataset layer that the user wishes to no longer write, then they would delete the matching feature type from the workspace.

Whenever all feature types are deleted from a Writer then FME will prompt the user to decide whether to remove the Writer component as well.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img4.67.RemoveWriterFTWarning.jpg)

This makes sense because if there are no feature types you wish to write, why would you still wish to write the dataset at all?

If you answer No, then the feature types are all removed, but the Writer is left in the translation. We call this a "dangling” Writer, because it has no children in the hierarchy.

######TIP
*A dangling Writer isn’t as much of a problem as a Reader, since there is no data to be written, although it can cause a loss of performance depending on other (advanced) factors such as the order of Writers.*
