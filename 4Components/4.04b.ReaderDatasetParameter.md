## Reader Dataset Parameters ##

As you may have noticed, among the different parameters for each Reader are ones to define which dataset it is reading.

Therefore, to select a dataset , these are the parameters you use. The dataset being read is NOT defined by a canvas object.

As usual, double-clicking the parameter opens a dialog for it to be changed. You can change the dataset being read by selecting any other dataset - of the same format - within that dialog.

Each Reader is capable of reading multiple source datasets.

When dealing with files (as opposed to databases) FME recognizes two different types of dataset: File-based and Folder-based


### File-Based Datasets ###
The key characteristic of a file-based dataset is that all layers (feature types) are stored within a single file. Basically a format in this classification will have a way to assign data to different
layers within a single file.

An AutoCAD DWG file is a good example of this: each DWG file is a separate dataset, and each DWG file has its own set of layers. 

For tabular data, Excel is a good example. A single Excel file can contain multiple sheets of data.

In this scenario the dataset parameter is simply a pointer to the location of the file(s).

Notice here the source dataset is a single .DWG AutoCAD file.


### Folder-Based Datasets ###
In this class of format, layers are stored as separate files. In other words, a format of this type DOES NOT have a way to assign data to different layers within a single file; therefore each ‘layer’ is a separate file.

An Esri Shape dataset is a good example of this: a single Shape file cannot store different layers (for example, roads and railway). To create that structure you would have two Shape files: roads.shp and railway.shp

For tabular data, comma-separated (CSV) or column-aligned (CAT) files are of this type. It's simply not possible to create separate tables inside a simple text file.

Reading folder-based datasets is not quite as logical as reading a file-based dataset. Rather than select the folder and prompt which feature types (files) to read, the user is prompted to select the files (feature types) directly.

In this way, the dataset and feature type selection can be made in a single step. It’s more efficient, just a little less logical.

######TIP
*Both File or Folder dataset parameters can be pointers to a Zip file. You simply select the zip file in the source parameter and FME will extract the data when it is being read.*

*Similarly, a File or Folder dataset can be read directly from a URL. Simply enter the URL into the source parameter. For Folder datasets the URL must point to a zip file containing all of the relevant files.*
