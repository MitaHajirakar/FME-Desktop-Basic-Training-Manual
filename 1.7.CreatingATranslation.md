# Creating a Translation #

Workbench’s intuitive interface makes it easy to set up and run a simple format-to-format ('quick') translation.

## The Start Tab ##
The Start Tab in FME Workbench includes a section called "Getting Started." This section has links to the different ways in which a workspace can be created. The simplest method is Generate Workspace:

## Generate Workspace Dialog ##
The Generate Workspace dialog condenses all the choices to be made into a single dialog box.

The Generate Workspace dialog has fields for defining the format and location of both the data to be read, and the data to be written.

All format selection fields in FME are both a pull-down menu and a text entry field. The drop-down list shows the last ten formats used, so favourite formats are instantly available.

The text entry field allows you to type a format name directly. It has an 'intelli-complete' function that selects close matches as you type.

Format selection can also be made from a table showing ALL of the formats supported by FME. To access this table, select 'More Formats...' from the foot of the drop-down formats list.

Dataset selection fields are a text entry field, but with a browse button to open an explorer-like dialog.

Red coloring in an FME dialog indicates mandatory fields. Users must enter data in these fields to continue. In most dialogs the OK button is de-activated until the mandatory fields are complete.
 
## Feature Types Dialog ##
Whenever a source dataset contains multiple layers the user is prompted to select which are to be translated.

This is achieved through the Select Feature Types dialog. In FME 'Feature Type' is another term for 'layer.' Only selected layers show in the workspace.

Here, for example, is a Select Feature Types dialog where the user has chosen to include all available layers within the workspace.

In the Generate Workspace dialog, why might it be useful to set the data format before browsing for the source data?

Try browsing for a dataset before setting the format type and see if you can detect the difference.

 
## The New Workspace ##
A new workspace reads from left to right, from the layers in a source (Reader), through a dataflow to the layers in a destination (Writer). One could also think of these as the Extract-Transform-Load stages of a spatial ETL process.

Arrows denote the direction of data flow, from source to destination.

> Terminology: In most cases FME uses the terms 'Reader' and 'Writer' instead of 'Source’ and ‘Destination.' A later chapter explains the why. For now, just be aware that a Reader reads datasets and a Writer writes datasets, and these terms are analogous to source/destination and input/output.


## Saving the Workspace ##
Workspaces can be saved to a file so that they can be reused at a later date. The save button on the toolbar is one way to do this:

There are also menu options to do the same thing, in this case File > Save (shortcut = Ctrl+S) or File > Save As.

The default file extension is .fmw. Double-clicking a *.fmw file in Explorer starts FME Workbench and opens up the workspace.”

## Running a Workspace ##

The green arrow (or 'play' button) on the Workbench toolbar starts a translation:

There are also options under Run on the menubar:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img1.18.RunningWorkspace.2.png)

The Run menu with run options include shortcut keys that can be used – the F5 key to simply run a translation and Ctrl+R to prompt and run a translation:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img1.19.RunningWorkspace.3.png)

The 'Run' option carries out a translation using the same parameters and settings used previously. The 'Prompt and Run' option prompts for new values for parameters and settings.

Regardless of this, however, the 'Run' option must still prompt for parameters that have not yet been filled in and don’t have default values.

 
## Workspace Results ##
After running a workspace related information and statistics are found in the Workbench log window.

The translation log reveals whether the translation succeeded or failed, how many features were read from the source and written to the destination, and how long it took to perform the translation.

In this example the log file reveals that 3995 features were read from a MicroStation DGN file.

These features were written to a MapInfo TAB dataset..

The overall process was a success (with some warnings).

The elapsed time for the translation was 1.1 seconds.

> 1. Typing the format name
> 2. Selecting it from a drop-down list
> 3. Browsing the formats gallery
> 4. By selecting a dataset with a known file extension
> 5. None of the above (they are all valid ways to set the format)
