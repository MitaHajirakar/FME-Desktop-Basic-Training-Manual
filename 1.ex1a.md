Let's start using FME to do a simple file format translation. We’ve outlined all of the actions you need to take – although FME's interface is so intuitive you might be able to carry out the exercise without the need for step- by- step instructions. 


1) Start FME Workbench by selecting it from the Windows start menu. You’ll find it under Start > All Programs > FME Desktop 2015.0 > FME Workbench 2015.0.

2) FME Workbench will start up and begin with the Start tab active. In the Getting Started part of the Start tab, select the option to Generate Workspace. Alternatively you can use the shortcut Ctrl+G. 

3) The Generate Workspace tool opens up a dialog in which to define the translation to be carried out. Fill in the fields in this dialog as follows:

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">MapInfo TAB (MITAB)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\Zoning\Zones.tab</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Format</td>
<td style="">Autodesk AutoCAD DWG/DXF</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Output\Training\Zones.dwg</td>
</tr>

</table>

Remember, you can set a format by typing its name, by selecting it from the drop- down list, or by choosing “More Formats” and selecting the format from the full table of formats. For now, ignore the Workflow Options and leave the default of 'Static Schema.'


4) Click OK to close the Generate Workspace dialog. A new workspace will be generated into the FME Workbench canvas: 


Click the arrow icon on each object to expose a list of attributes in the data.

5) Run the workspace by clicking the run button on the toolbar, or by using Run > Run Translation on the menubar. The translation will run and the log file report something like this:


6) Locate the destination data in Windows Explorer to prove that it's been written as expected. In the next section we’ll cover how to inspect the dataset to ensure that it is correct.

When a translation is run immediately in Workbench or Quick Translator, without further adjustment, it's known as a 'Quick Translation.' Because FME is a 'semantic' translator, with an enhanced data model, the output from a quick translation is as close to the source data in structure and meaning as possible, given the capabilities of the destination format.

Congratulations! You have now:
