## How FME Works
At the heart of FME is an engine that supports an array of data types and data formats; from GIS and CAD to BIM and Point Cloud, via XML, Raster, databases, and many more.

### Rich Data Model
The capability to handle so many data types is made possible by a rich data model designed to cover all possible geometries and attributes. 

When limitations in the destination (output) format cause incompatibility, FME automatically compensates to create a seamless translation process.
