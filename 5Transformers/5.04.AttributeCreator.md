## AttributeCreator ##
With functionality for string concatenation and expression evaluation the AttributeCreator is the all-singing, all-dancing transformer of choice for handling attributes in workspaces.

There is an ever-lengthening list of capabilities for this transformer, but the main ones are:

- Manually Create an Attribute
- Set an Attribute Value
- Copy an Attribute


### Manually Create an Attribute ###
The fundamental purpose of this transformer is to manually enter an attribute name and value for it. It is essentially an author-defined constant since every feature gets the same value.

### Set an Attribute Value ###
Because the Attribute Name field allows an attribute to be selected from a list, it can be used to set the value of an existing attribute, rather than manually entering a new attribute name. Again, this is an author-defined constant, since every feature gets the same value for that attribute.

### Copy an Attribute (Can replace the AttributeCopier) ###
Since the Value field allows an attribute to be selected from a list, this transformer can be used in place of an AttributeCopier, to copy the value from one attribute into another (either a new attribute, or an existing one).

Here the user is:

- Manually creating a new attribute and setting a value for it
- Setting a value for an existing attribute
- Copying an existing attribute to a new one
