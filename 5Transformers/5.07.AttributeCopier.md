## AttributeCopier ##
The AttributeCopier transformer is similar in structure to the AttributeRenamer – obviously retaining the old attribute as well as creating the new – but in a much simpler dialog.

The source attribute is simply a pick list, and the target can either be an existing attribute or a newly defined one.

The dialog also includes a Default Value field so that the newly copied attribute can (optionally) be given a new value.

Again this is of use when wanting to read data that has one schema (set of attribute names) and write it to a dataset that needs a different schema.
