## Copying and Renaming an Attribute ##
### Copy an Attribute (Can replace the AttributeCopier) ###
Since the Value field allows an attribute to be selected from a list, this transformer can be used in place of an AttributeCopier, to copy the value from one attribute into another (either a new attribute, or an existing one).

Here the user is:

- Manually creating a new attribute and setting a value for it
- Setting a value for an existing attribute
- Copying an existing attribute to a new one



The AttributeCopier transformer is similar in structure to the AttributeRenamer – obviously retaining the old attribute as well as creating the new – but in a much simpler dialog.

The source attribute is simply a pick list, and the target can either be an existing attribute or a newly defined one.

The dialog also includes a Default Value field so that the newly copied attribute can (optionally) be given a new value.

Again this is of use when wanting to read data that has one schema (set of attribute names) and write it to a dataset that needs a different schema.
