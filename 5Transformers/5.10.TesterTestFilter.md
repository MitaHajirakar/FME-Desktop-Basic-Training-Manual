## The Tester and TestFilter Transformers ##


### Tester ###
The Tester transformer is the key transformer for conditional filtering of data.

Not only can the Tester (number 1 in the top 25) carry out single tests, it allows the combination of multiple tests, where a user can combine any number of clauses using an AND and OR statement.

This Tester simply filters address features, depending on whether they are part of the V6E postal code. It also demonstrates the usefulness of annotating a workspace!

This Tester is using the AND pass criteria. Here all clauses must apply for a feature to pass the test. In this case an address must be in postal code V6E and also be a commercial property.

Non-commercial properties in V6E, or commercial properties in a different postal code, will fail this test.

#### Operators ####
There are a number of operators available in the Tester transformer (or in many of the other locations that make use of the Tester dialog):

Besides the usual operators, there are also some based on a SQL where clause. These include:

- In
- Between
- Like
- Matches Regex
- Contains
- Begins With
- Ends With

…plus there are other tests that test for the existence of attributes and values:

- Attribute is Null
- Attribute is Empty String
- Attribute is Missing


### TestFilter ###
The TestFilter (#12 in the top 25) is essentially a way to combine multiple Tester transformers into one.

Because of this, it’s equivalent to a whole string of Testers, and similar to the CASE or SWITCH command in programming or scripting languages. Instead of the Tester's single Passed and Failed ports, you can create an output port for each condition (it does not need to be called "Passed") and an output port for features that fail all of the test conditions.

The TestFilter has the full set of operands available with the Tester such as equals, greater than, less than, and so forth. Each condition is tested in turn.

Features that pass are output through the matching output port. Features that fail are sent on to the next condition in the list. Therefore it’s very important to get the conditions in the correct order.

TestFilter also lets the output ports be individually named, which is very convenient.

######TIP
*Because the TestFilter can operate as a single Tester transformer would, it’s possible to replace all instances of the Tester in a workspace with a TestFilter.*

In this example the user has used three Tester transformers (and six connections) to filter out the different parts of this data.

With the TestFilter, the three Testers are now replaced with one single transformer and there are only four connections.

Also notice how the TestFilter output ports have custom naming. This is another advantage to this transformer.
