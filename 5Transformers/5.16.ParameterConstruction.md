# Constructing Transformer Parameters #
Besides direct use of attributes FME also allows you to integrate string construction and arithmetic calculations within transformer parameters.


## Using Attributes for Parameters ##
Many transformer parameters allow the user to select an attribute value instead of manually entering a fixed value. For example, the LabelPointReplacer can create a label whose contents and height are specified by attribute values:

This is very useful because it allows the parameter (here label size) to get a different value for each feature. One feature could create a label 10 units in height, another feature could create one 15 units high, and so on. It is no longer a fixed value.

However, FME takes the concept a step further by integrating string and numeric editors into parameter dialogs, so that values can be not just taken from an attribute, but can be constructed from a mix of attributes and other user inputs.

For example, here the user is choosing to calculate label height using an arithmetic calculator:

The calculator allows the selection and use of FME attributes, other parameters, plus a number of mathematical and string-based functions. For example, here the user has chosen to use a Log() function to calculate the height of their labels:

### Reducing Workspace Congestion ###
Integrated text and arithmetic editors provide a great benefit for workspace creation.

Workspaces will be more compact and well-defined when as many peripheral operations as possible are directly integrated into transformers; In other words, when a single transformer can be used instead of a number of transformers used in series.

For example, the LabelPointReplacer can calculate label heights without the need for a prior ExpressionEvaluator transformer.

In this way the number of transformers required to carry out a single task is reduced.

It’s important to note one particular drawback of the integrated method: you don’t get the information as an attribute to use elsewhere. For example, you can’t create and use a string AND also have it as an output attribute. For that you would need the AttributeCreator as usual.
