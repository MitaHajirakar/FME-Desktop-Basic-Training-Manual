## Transformer Searching ##
There are search functions in both the transformer gallery and Quick Add dialog.

To perform a search in the transformer gallery, simply enter the search terms and either press the <enter> key or click the search icon (the binoculars icon).

The transformer gallery search searches in both name and description. Therefore a search term may be the exact name of a transformer, or it may be a general keyword referring to functionality in general:

Search terms can either be full or partial words, and may consist of a number of keywords, including quote marks to enclose a single search reference.

Quick Add search-terms can also be full or partial words:

By default, Quick Add does not look in transformer descriptions, so the search term must be the actual name of a transformer.

However, Quick Add will search in the transformer descriptions if you press the <TAB> key.

Quick Add results include aliases - for example transformers that have an alternative name or which have been renamed - and also include transformers found in the FME Store.

The FME Store is a facility for sharing (and selling) FME functionality such as custom transformers and formats.

Such transformers are flagged in the search tools with a small, downwards-pointing arrow icon.

The full set of available transformers can be browsed by visiting fmestore.safe.com

Quick Add also allows the use of CamelCase initials as a shortcut. CamelCase is where a single keyword is made up of several conjoined words, each of which retains an upper case initial; for example AttributeFileWriter (AFW) or ShortestPathFinder (SPF).

For example, Quick Add will return the ShortestPathFinder when the search term is the initials “spf”:
