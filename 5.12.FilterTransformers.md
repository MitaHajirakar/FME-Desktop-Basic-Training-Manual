## Other Key Filter Transformers ##
The Tester and TestFilter are not the only useful filter transformers.


### AttributeFilter ###
The AttributeFilter transformer (#5 in the top 25) directs features on the basis of values in a chosen attribute.

In this example features are divided into different postal codes depending on the value of a PostalCode attribute.

>The Tester is best for simple yes/no decisions, such as "Heads or Tails" or "Are you 21 years or older".

>The AttributeFilter is best for testing many values for a single attribute; for example "Is your hair color Black, Brown, Red, Grey, or Another Color.
>
>The TestFilter is best for filtering a feature by a set of cascading conditions; for example to play in the FME golf tournament you must pass one of these conditions: "Are you a previous champion," "Have you won another tournament in the last 5 years," "Were you in the top 16 in last year's tournament," "Are you in the top-30 player rankings," etc.

If your workspace looks like this then an AttributeFilter transformer might be a better option.

If the conditions were mathematical (for example, size > 100), then the TestFilter would be the best choice.

### AttributeRangeFilter ###
The AttributeRangeFilter carries out the same operation as the AttributeFilter, except that it can handle a range of numeric values instead of just a simple one-to-one match.

The AttributeRangeFilter parameters dialog has the option to generate ranges automatically from a set of user-defined extents.

 
### GeometryFilter ###
The GeometryFilter (#11 in the top 25) directs features on the basis of geometry type; for example, point, line, area, ellipse.

The GeometryFilter is useful for:

- Filtering out unwanted geometry types; for example removing text features before using an AreaBuilder transformer
- Dividing up geometry types to write to separate destination Feature Types; for example, when writing to a geometry-restricted format such as Esri Shape

 
### ChangeDetector ###
The ChangeDetector detects changes between two sets of input features and routes data based on the results of this comparison.

- **UNCHANGED** features are those present in both the original and revised streams
- **ADDED** features only exist in the revised stream and ‘DELETED’ features only exist in the original stream
