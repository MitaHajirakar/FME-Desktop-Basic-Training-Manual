## Bookmarks ##
A bookmark, like its real-world namesake, is a means of putting a marker down for easy access.

With FME the bookmark covers an area of workspace that is usually carrying out a specific task, so a user can pick it out of a larger set of transformers and move to it with relative ease.


### Why use Bookmarks? ###
Bookmarks play an important role in a well-styled workspace for a number of reasons, including these.

- Sectioning: For dividing up a workspace into different - clearly marked - sections.
- Quick Access: For placing a marker for quick access to a certain part.
- Organization: For moving about groups of transformers at a time.


### Adding a Bookmark ###
To add a bookmark, click the Bookmark icon on the toolbar.

Whereas a traditional bookmark marks just a single page in a book, the FME bookmark can cover a wide area of the canvas. A single workspace can be divided into different sections by applying multiple bookmarks.

If any objects on the workspace canvas are selected when a bookmark is created, the bookmark expands to include those items.


### Resizing and Editing a Bookmark ###
To resize a bookmark simply hover over a corner or edge and then drag the cursor to change the bookmark size or shape.

Double-clicking a bookmark title allows the color and title of the bookmark to be edited.

Bookmarks are shown either as a frame around white-space or filled with color.

Tools > FME Options on the menu bar opens a dialog with a number of sections, one of which (Workbench) has an option to have color-filled bookmarks.

 
### Bookmark Options ###
Right-click a bookmark to show the following options:

- Delete: Delete the bookmark
- Duplicate: Create a duplicate bookmark
- Rename: Edit the bookmark title
- Edit Bookmark Description: Edit the description of the bookmark
- Select All Objects in Bookmark: All objects (transformers included) in the bookmark are selected
- Properties: Open a dialog to set bookmark name and color.

A bookmark description shows as a block of text inside the bookmark. Like annotation, it can be styled to a specific font or color.

 
### Bookmarks for Sectioning ###
A bookmark is a great way of indicating that a particular section of a workspace is for a particular purpose. By subdividing a workspace in this way, the layout is often a lot easier to follow. Think of bookmarks as being like the chapter headings in a book!

This workspace illustrates nicely how to mark up different sections of a workspace using Bookmarks.

If you use bookmarks for nothing else, use them to divide your workspace into easily identifiable sections. It really makes the canvas more readable.


### Bookmarks for Quick Access ###
If a workspace is sectioned with bookmarks, they can be used to navigate to a particular section.

Bookmarks are listed on the Workbench Navigator.

Clicking a bookmark here selects that bookmark and brings it into view.

Double-clicking it selects the bookmark and brings it into the centre of the view.

Right-clicking it shows the same options as right-clicking a bookmark on the canvas.

In FME2015, the Navigator window now shows bookmarks as folders, capable of being expanded to display their contents.

 
### Bookmarks for Organization ###
A bookmark 'magnet' is a toggle that has a status represented by the icon shown in its top-left corner.

The default status of a bookmark magnet is active. Clicking the icon lets a user de-activate or re-activate the magnet.

This feature aids in organizing a workspace because an active magnet (red) causes objects on the canvas to move as the bookmark is moved. Therefore large groups of transformers can be moved about the workspace canvas to create a clearer layout.

An inactive magnet (blue) allows the bookmark to be moved without disturbing the contents, which is also useful in some situations.

> "In my considered opinion, it's perfectly legal to nest bookmarks. Nesting means to place one bookmark inside another. In this manner each ‘section' of a workspace can be divided into subsections."
