You have been handed a set of crime statistics in CSV (Comma Separated) format and asked to create a map from them. In order to map the data you will need to merge it onto a set of spatial features, such as city blocks.


**1) Inspect Source Data (Crime)**
<br>The first task is to familiarize yourself with the source data. To do this open the following dataset within the FME Data Inspector or a simple text editor.

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Comma Separated Value (CSV)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\Emergency\Crime2011.csv</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Parameters</td>
<td style="">File Has Field Names: Yes (Checked)<br>Lines to Skip: Header 1</td>
</tr>

</table>


The data will look like this in the Data Inspector Table View window:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.69.DataInspectorTableView.jpg)

Notice how there is a block number, but no other spatial information.


**2) Inspect Source Data (Roads)**
<br>Now let's inspect some spatial data that we can merge the crime statistics onto. Open the following dataset in the Data Inspector

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Autodesk AutoCAD DWG/DXF</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\Transportation\Roads.dwg</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Parameters</td>
<td style="">Group Entities By: Attribute Schema</td>
</tr>

</table>


You'll see that the roads dataset has a block number that is an almost identical match to the crime figures; the only difference is that the road block attribute is (for example) "2400" whereas the crime data is "24XX."

The other difference is that the road data is stored in Title case ("Bute St") in the roads dataset, whereas the crime dataset is upper case ("BUTE ST").


**3) Add Readers**
<br>Now let's start working with this data. Start FME Workbench and begin with a blank canvas.

Add a Reader to the workspace using Readers > Add Reader from the menubar. This
Reader should be used to read the crime (CSV) data. Be sure to use the same parameters as specified for the Data Inspector.

Now add a second Reader to read the roads (DWG) data. However, from inspecting the data, I see that the roads are stored on a set of seven different layers. We don't need that, so set the "Single Merged Feature Type" parameter when adding the Reader, like so:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.70.SingleFeatureTypes.jpg)

Again, be sure to use the same Group Entities By parameter as specified for the Data Inspector.

The workspace will now look like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.71.WorkspaceFeatureTypes.jpg)



**4) Add StringReplacer**
<br>To merge the data we need a common block attribute. The current difference in how the block is structured ("00" vs "XX") can be fixed very simply with a StringReplacer transformer.

Add a StringReplacer transformer and connect it to the Crime dataset feature type.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.72.StringReplacerInWorkspace.jpg)

Open the parameters dialog for the StringReplacer. Set the proper parameters. The Attribute to process will be "Block", the Text to Match will be "XX" and the Replacement Text will be "00", like so:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.73.StringReplacerParametersDialog.jpg)

Click OK to accept the values. If you wish, attach Inspector transformers and run the workspace to ensure the transformer is working as expected.


**5) Add StringCaseChanger**
<br>The other difference in crime/road data was in UPPER/Title case street names. This disparity can be fixed with a StringCaseChanger transformer.

Add a StringCaseChanger transformer and connect it to the roads dataset feature type:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.74.StringCaseChangerOnWorkspace.jpg)

Open the parameters dialog. Set the parameters to change the values of HBlock to upper case:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.75.StringCaseChangerParametersDialog.jpg)


######Q+A
*Why are we using the StringCaseChanger transformer here and not the
BulkAttributeRenamer (which also transforms items to upper case)? There's an
obvious difference between the two - but do you know what it is?*


**6) Add FeatureMerger**
<br>Now we've sorted out the structure of our join keys we can merge the data together with a FeatureMerger.

Add a FeatureMerger to the canvas. Connect the roads data as the Requestor and the crime data as the Supplier (we wish to supply the roads data with crime statistics):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.76.FeatureMergerInWorkspace.jpg)

If, like me, you don't like connections that cross over, feel free to swap the position of the objects around to untangle it.

Open the parameters dialog for the FeatureMerger.

For the "Join On" set of parameters, the Requestor join attribute will be HBlock, the Supplier join attribute will be Block, and the Comparison Mode will be String:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.77.FeatureMergerParametersDialog.jpg)

######TIP
*If you are sharp, you may have noticed that the Requestor and Supplier parameters can be defined within a text edit window.*

*That means, instead of using the transformers we just added, we could replicate
their functionality using functions inside that text editor, like so:*

<pre>
@ReplaceString(@Value(Block),XX,00)
@UpperCase(@Value(HBlock))
</pre>

*We'll learn more about constructing values like this in the next section of this
chapter!*

For the "Merge Parameters" the Feature Merge Type should be Attributes Only. Because we can expect multiple crimes per block the parameter Process Duplicate Suppliers should be set to Yes. Set the Number of Suppliers Attribute to be "NumberOfCrimes" - this will create an attribute of that name recording how many crimes occurred in that block.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.78.FeatureMergerParametersDialog.jpg)

Finally, the attribute accumulation needs to be "Merge Supplier."

Click OK to close the dialog.


**7) Add Inspectors**
<br>Add Inspector transformers to the Merged and NotMerged output ports (or connect both outputs to one Inspector). This will give us the roads data with crime info attached. The NotMerged data is important because there may be blocks without any crime.

The Unreferenced output port will show us crimes that didn't match to a known address, so connect a Logger transformer here to record any features that fail in this respect.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.79.InspectorTransformersInWorkspace.jpg)


**8) Save and Run Translation**
<br>Save the workspace and then run the translation. By querying a block you should be able to see (in the Feature Information window) a list of all the crimes that occurred in that block.


**Advanced**
<br>We've now successfully merged crime statistics onto a set of spatial data, which is what the aim of the example was. However, it does leave us in a fairly unsatisfactory state, not having output or processed those figures in any way.
As an advanced task, if you have time, let's try handling the data we've just merged.



**9) Add MapnikRasterizer**
<br>The MapnikRasterizer is a way of creating nicely formatted raster map output from a set of vector data.

Place a MapnikRasterizer transformer connected to the Merged output port of the
FeatureMerger:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.80.MapnikRasterizerInWorkspace.jpg)

Open the parameters dialog. Set the output layer to be a Line symbolizer. Then click the Edit button to the right.

For the Line Width (pixels) parameter click the drop down arrow and select Attribute Value > Number of Crimes. Click OK to close the dialog.

Set the output raster size to be 2500 cells for both Columns and Rows.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.81.MapnikRasterizerParametersDialog.jpg)


**10) Run Workspace**
<br>Now you can add an Inspector and run the workspace.

######TIP
*It's a good step to turn off background maps in the Data Inspector first - else there will be a delay while the raster output is reprojected to match.*

The output will look like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img5.82.MapnikRasterizerOutputInDI.jpg)

Basically we've created a map where road width reflects the amount of crime on that block.

The image is fairly basic at the moment, but you can enhance it by adding more layers to the MapnikRasterizer (merge in some orthophoto data perhaps) and/or adjusting some of the other parameters like background image.


**Congratulations! You have now:**

- Pre-processed data to get join keys with a matching structure
- Joined non-spatial data onto spatial features using a join key
- Advanced: Created a map output of merged attributes
