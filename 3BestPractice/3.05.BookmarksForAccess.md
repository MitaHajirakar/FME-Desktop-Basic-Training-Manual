### Bookmarks for Quick Access ###
Bookmarks are listed on the Workbench Navigator. Each bookmark is depicted as a folder and can be expanded to show its contents. This may include feature types, transformers, or other - nested - bookmarks:

Clicking a bookmark in the Navigator selects that bookmark and brings it into view.

Double-clicking it selects the bookmark and brings it into the centre of the view.

So, when bookmarks have been used to divide a workspace into sections, they can also be used to navigate between different parts of that workspace.


### Workspace Presentation ###
Bookmarks also appear on this section of the FME Workbench toolbar:

Besides being a way to quickly access bookmarks, this tool can be used as what is known as "Presentation Mode" in FME Workbench. By clicking the + button you flip from bookmark to bookmark, using animation, in a way that would be very useful when showing the workspace as part of a presentation.
