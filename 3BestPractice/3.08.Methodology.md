# Methodology #
Methodology is all about using the tools you have in the way they were intended. If you have experience of software development you might be aware of the concept of **design patterns**. According to Wikipedia:

> *Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system*

Design patterns make for a simplified and efficient development process. Likewise, using Workbench the right way makes for a more productive and efficient FME experience.
