## FME Projects ##
FME is often used not just for one-off translations, but for a particular project or series of projects.

Project best practice involves suggestions more than hard and fast rules; but suggestions that are highly recommended!

### Folder Structure ###
Project use of FME is more efficient when a proper project structure is maintained.

For example, assuming a special disk for storing projects (P:), a simple project structure could include a project ID if you have one; for example: **P:\P2016\_999\_PROPERTY\_UPDATES**

Follow this with subfolders, such as:

-	**.\FMEworkspaces**	which could itself have subfolders such as
	-	**.\Templates** 	for templates
	-	**.\Scripts** 	for Python, SQL, or Tcl scripts
- **.\SourceData** 	for storing source dataset files
- **.\OutputData** 	for storing destination dataset files
- **.\NoteDocs&Stuff**  	project estimates, specifications, proposals, etc.
- **.\Testing** 	a folder for test data and workspaces

For a large scale FME project, set up a project structure and stick to it. Keep copies of all FME workspaces, maybe in a revision control system like Subversion or GitHub.

### File Naming ###
Based on past experience the Safe Professional Services team has the following recommendations for file and folder naming within an FME project:

- Use revision numbers on workspaces or folders; for example, myworkspace_rev17.fmw.
	- It's tempting to save to the same workspace all the time, but then there is no fallback position from a mistake.
- When using dates for file names or folders, use international dates such as 2015-03-21 or 20150321 so files are listed in the correct order. Do not use a date such as Mar-21-15, which will be listed alphabetically after April in Windows Explorer.
- Reduce clutter in the project's main folder by saving files inside subfolders.
- Avoid meaningless folderand filenames, such as 'fr_clnt'. From Client? Father Clint?!
- Share ideas with others. Make sure all users conform to the same conventions.

### Relative Paths ###
Although it isn't possible to browse for a relative path, it is possible to manually edit a path to be relative; for example, change P:\P2016-999\SourceData\myfile.dgn to .\SourceData\myfile.dgn.

The advantage of doing this is that if the original project is renamed or even moved to a new location, all of the workspaces will still function correctly without further editing.
