## Testing Isolated Sections ##
Testing and debugging a large workspace is easier when it's possible to isolate sections and test them separately. 

The ability to isolate specific sections is done by disabling connections. This renders a connection inoperative in much the same way as if it had been deleted, and no features will pass through.

A connection is disabled by right-clicking it and choosing the option to Disable (or selecting it and using the shortcut Ctrl+E):

Disabled connections are listed in the Navigator window:

Here the user has chosen to disable connections so that they can test the first PointOnAreaOverlayer transformer without the second one running as well:

This speeds up the translation so that testing of the required section runs quicker.

Of course, it's much easier to disable certain parts of a workspace when you've properly divided it up into sections with bookmarks. Anyway, here's a question for you:
<br><br>It's possible to disable other objects besides connections. Can you pick out which of these objects (there may be more than one) can be disabled in Workbench?
<br><br>1. Transformers
<br>2. Feature Types
<br>3. Annotation
<br>4. Bookmarks
</span>
