## Testing Isolated Sections ##
Testing and debugging a large workspace is easier when it's possible to isolate sections and test them separately. Of course, it will help this technique if the workspace is already properly divided using bookmarks!

The ability to isolate specific sections is done by disabling connections. This renders a connection inoperative in much the same way as if it had been deleted, and no features will pass through.

For large workspaces the disable functionality is very useful. It enables the author to isolate sections of a workspace from being executed, so that tests run much more efficiently.

Here the workspace has two outputs from the BulkAttributeRemover , creating two separate parts to the workspace. The user wishes to run the workspace only on one section, so disables the second connection.

Now no data will be sent to the GeometryFilter for processing in that section.

Connections can be disabled by clicking on them and using the shortcut Ctrl+E. This keyboard shortcut is a toggle that alternates between enabled and disabled. Alternatively, you can right-click on a connection and use the disable option.

######***CAUTION!***
*As well as connections, you can disable any object on the canvas; for example a transformer or a feature type.*
