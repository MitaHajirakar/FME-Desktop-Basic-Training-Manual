In this exercise, you are a GIS technician working for a city planning department.

Today's project is for city residents. You have been asked to set up a system where they can enter their address and find out local information; for example what neighborhood is the address is, what public trees grow nearby, where is the nearest library, and when is the garbage collection day.

You realize this can be done relatively easy using transformers in FME for attribute handling, filtering, and data joins.


**1) Inspect Source Data**
<br>Use the FME Data Inspector to inspect all of the datasets listed below, in order to familiarize yourself with the data.


**2) Start Workbench**
<br>Start FME Workbench and begin with an empty canvas.

Now let's first consider our strategy here. The first part of the project will be to extract the address we want. In lieu of using a "proper" database, we'll read all of the address features and filter out the one we want with a Tester transformer.


**3) Add Reader**
<br>Add a Reader to read the following dataset:

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Esri Geodatabase (File Geodb API)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\Addresses\Addresses.gdb</td>
</tr>

</table>

######TIP
*Be sure to check the Workflow Options parameter. In this exercise it needs to be
"Individual Feature Types". However, if you've previously set this parameter to
"Single Merged Feature Type" it may default to that without you being aware!
When prompted the feature type to add is PostalAddress.*



**4) Add Tester**
<br>Add a Tester transformer to the workspace. Set it up to test for a specific address. For this exercise we'll take the easy way and hard code that address. You can pick one from the Data Inspector (for example, 990 Bute St).

X

Connect Inspector transformers and try the workspace to make sure it works correctly. Only one address should pass.


**5) Add Readers**
<br>Now let's start to gather information about this address. To do this let's add two new Readers, the first of which is:

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Esri Geodatabase (File Geodb API)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\CommunityMapping\CommunityMap.gdb</td>
</tr>

</table>

When prompted deselect everything except GarbageSchedule from the list of feature types (we'll use this now) and also Libraries, which we'll use later.

Now add the second new Reader:

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Google Earth KML</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\Boundaries\VancouverNeighborhoods.kml</td>
</tr>

</table>

The feature type you need here is Neighborhoods. De-select everything else.
The workspace will look like this:

X


**6) Add PointOnAreaOverlayer**
<br>Add a PointOnAreaOverlayer transformer to the workspace. Connect the Tester Passed port to the Point input port, and the GarbageSchedule feature type to the Area:

X

Check the transformer parameters, but you do not need to change anything; none will have any effect here.


**7) Clean Schema**
<br>Attach an Inspector and run the workspace. You'll see that there are several attributes added from the garbage data:

- Zone
- Subzone
- Schedule
- NumAddresses

The only one of these we really need is Schedule. So use an AttributeRenamer to rename it to GarbageSchedule, and use either an AttributeKeeper, AttributeRemover, or even an AttributeRenamer to delete the other garbage attributes.


**8) Add Reprojector**
<br>Now we can start to use the Neighborhood data. However, because it is in a Lat/Long coordinate system (the address and other data is UTM83-10) we'll need to reproject it first.

Add a Reprojector transformer after the Neighborhood feature type. Open the parameters dialog and set it to reproject from the source feature coordinate system to UTM83-10:

X

Now this is done you can repeat the previous two steps (PointOnAreaOverlayer/Clean Schema) to determine which Neighborhood the address is in; the neighborhood name is the attribute we require. If you add the PointOnAreaOverlayer before the AttributeRenamer then you can re-use these two attribute-handling transformer for this step:

X


**9) Add NeighborFinder**
<br>The NeighborFinder is a tool for joining data on proximity. Add a NeighborFinder with the address (PointOnAreaOverlayer) output connected to the Base port and the Libraries dataset connected to the Candidate.

X

Open the parameters dialog. Set the Maximum Distance to be 1000 (in this case it is metres).


**10) Run Workspace**
<br>Again, update your transformers to get rid of what you consider excess attributes, add an Inspector, and run the workspace.

The Table View in the Data Inspector should show the newly merged attributes:

X

In this case, the garbage schedule is Tuesday, the neighborhood West End, and the nearest library is called Joe Fortes.


**11) Add Joiner**
Now to add some information about what trees exist in the area. Add a Joiner transformer to retrieve this information from a CSV dataset. Open the Parameters dialog.

Notice that the first task is to define the dataset to read from. It is:

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Comma Separated Value (CSV)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\Parks\PublicTrees.csv</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Parameters</td>
<td style="">File Has Field Names: Yes (Checked)<br>Lines to Skip: Header 1</td>
</tr>

</table>

In the Join parameters first select the table. There will only be a single table (either CSV or the file name itself).

Then set the join attributes. We need to join PSTLADDRESS to Address.

In Fields to Add select CommonName. The ability to select the attributes we want to merge means we won't have to remove them later.

Finally, because there may be more than one tree per address, under Multiple Matches select "Add Fields on a List Attribute" and then enter a list name (e.g. TreeList) underneath.

X

Click OK to close the dialog.


**12) Run Workspace**
<br>Run the workspace again. By querying the feature you should see that it now also has a list of trees (it won't appear in the Table View, only the Feature Information window):

X

**Advanced**

We've now successfully filtered, managed, and merge some data to identify key
properties for a given address; which is what the aim of the example was.  However, it does leave us in a fairly unsatisfactory state, not having output or processed the information in any way.

As an advanced task, if you have time, let's try handling the data we've just merged, by creating a report in HTML.


**13) Inspect HTML Template**
<br>Fortunately we already have a template for the HTML at:
C:\FMEData2015\Resources\AddressReportTemplate.html which you can open in a text editor to familiarize yourself with. Items marked like so...

<pre>
{fme:get-attribute("AttributeName")}
</pre>

...will be replaced with the attribute value when we process it in FME.


**14) Add XMLTemplater**
<br>Add an XMLTemplater transformer to the end of the workspace. This transformer will process the pre-defined HTML template with the information we've just extracted.

Open the parameters dialog. Set the Root Template source to be a file and browse to the file at: C:\FMEData2015\Resources\AddressReportTemplate.html

Set the Result Attribute to be called: text_line_data (this will match the output attribute in the Writer below).

Set the Write XML Header parameter to be No.

X


**15) Add Text File Writer**
<br>Now let's add a writer to write the HTML to. We can do this is a plain text writer:

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Format</td>
<td style="">Text File</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Output\Training\AddressReport.html</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Parameters</td>
<td style="">MIME Type: text/html</td>
</tr>

</table>

Connect the new feature type to the XMLTemplater output. Run the workspace. Open the output file in a web browser. The output should look something like this:

X


**Congratulations!**

You have now completed the exercise for this chapter.
