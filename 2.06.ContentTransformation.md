# Content Transformation #

Content transformations are those that operate on the geometry or attribute content of a dataset.

 
## What is a Feature? ##
A feature in FME is an individual item within the translation.

Typically a GIS or cartographic feature consists of a geometric representation plus a set of related attributes. FME is capable of restructuring either of these components.

A feature in FME is the fundamental (that is, smallest) unit of FME data.

Features in FME have a flexible, generic representation; in other words they have a basic FME definition that is unrelated to the format from which they originated.

Sometimes content transformation operates on single features, sometimes on multiple features at once.

## Geometric Transformation ##
***Geometric Transformation*** is the act of restructuring the spatial component of an FME feature. In other words, the physical geometry of the feature undergoes some form of change to produce a different output.

Some examples of geometric transformation include the following:

- **Generalization** – a cartographic process that restructures data so it's easily visualized at a given map scale.
- **Warping** – adjustment of the size and shape of a set of features to more closely match a set of reference data.
- **Topology Computation** – conversion of a set of linear features into a node/line structure.

Line Intersection is another example of geometric transformation.

Here roads have been intersected with rivers to produce points that mark the location of bridges.

## Attribute Transformation ##
***Attribute Transformation*** is the act of restructuring the non-spatial component of an FME feature. In other words, the attributes relating to the physical geometry undergo some form of change to produce a different output.

Some examples of attribute transformation are:

- **Concatenation** – joining together of two or more attributes
- **Splitting** – splitting one attribute into many, which is the opposite of Concatenation
- **Measurement** – measuring a feature's length or area to create a new attribute
- **ID Creation** – creating a unique ID number for a particular feature

Attribute concatenation as an example of attribute transformation.

Each line of the address is concatenated to return a single line address.
