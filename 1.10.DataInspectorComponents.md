# Major Components of the FME Data Inspector #

When the FME Data Inspector is started, and a dataset is opened, it looks something like this:

## Menu bar and Toolbar ##
The menu bar and toolbar contain a number of tools. Some are for navigating around the View window, some control administrative tasks such as opening or saving a dataset, and others are for special functionality such as selective filtering of data or the creation of dynamic attributes.

## View Window ##
The View window is the spatial display area of the FME Data Inspector. Multiple views of different datasets may be opened at any one time.

## Display Control Window ##
The Display Control window shows a list of the open datasets and their feature types. Tools here let users turn these on or off in the display, alter their symbology, and adjust the display order.

## Feature Information Window ##
When users query a feature in the View window, information about that feature is shown in the Information window. This information includes the featureâ€™s feature type, attributes (both user and format attributes), coordinate system and details about its geometry.

## Table View Window ##
The Table View window is a spreadsheet-like view of a dataset and includes all of the features and all of the attributes, with a separate tab for each feature type (layer).

## Log Window ##
The Log window reports information relating to the reading and look of a dataset that can be used to confirm whether data has been read correctly. Some functions on the toolbar also generate messages in the Log window.
