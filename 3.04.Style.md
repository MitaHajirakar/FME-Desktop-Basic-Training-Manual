A well-styled workspace provides many benefits as it is further developed and edited in the future.


## An FME Workspace Style Guide ##

Workspaces are rarely static or used repeatedly without being edited; sooner or later the source or destination schema will change, or edits will be needed to take advantage of new or updated FME functionality.

A good style of design makes it easier to navigate and understand an existing workspace, and thus simplifies the editing process. It’s very much like a computer programmer adding comments to explain his actions. As an example, nearly 30% of FME’s codebase consists of comment lines.

Specifically, a good style can help a user to…

- Distinctly define different sections or components of a workspace
- Quickly navigate to a specified section or particular transformer
- Pass a workspace on to another user for editing
- Rename workspaces and content with a more explanatory title
