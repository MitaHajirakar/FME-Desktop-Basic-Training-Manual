## Logging ##
The log window (and log file) contains a record of all stages and processes within a translation. The contents may appear complex, but such information is vital for interpreting a workspace's actions.
Message Types

There are a number of different message types that show in the log window including:

- An error in the log window, denoted by the term ERROR, indicates that a problem has caused FME to terminate processing.
- An inability to write the output dataset because of incorrect user permissions.
- A warning in the log window, denoted by the term WARN, indicates a processing problem. The problem is sufficiently minor to allow FME to complete the translation, but the output may be adversely affected and should be checked.
- An inability to write features with a geometry that's incompatible with the Writer format. FME can filter out these features, but will warn the user of their presence.
- Information messages, denoted by the term INFORM, indicate a piece of information that may help a user determine whether their translation has been processed correctly.
- The number of features processed by a transformer or confirmation of a particular dataset parameter.
- Statistics messages, denoted by the term STATS, provide information on the number of features read from the source and written to the destination datasets.
- The number of features processed by the workspace as a whole and the time taken to do so.

You can search for different types of messages by clicking in the log window and pressing Ctrl+F to open a search dialog.


### Log Options ###
Workbench has the ability to filter different message types from the log window. This is done using Tools > FME Options > Translation.

Adjusting the view of messages in this way does not affect the output written to the log file.

Turning off STATS and INFORM log messages helps to highlight WARN and ERROR messages in the log so there is less chance of missing them; though it does feel strange to watch a translation take place without the log window scrolling past as usual!

 

### Log Timings ###
Another useful option under Tools > FME Options > Translation is the ability to turn log timestamp information on or off.

Log timestamps indicate the absolute date and time for each step of the translation process. They also show the time taken by FME to process the previous stage and the cumulative time taken to reach that point in the translation.

Keep log timings turned on. They do add to the amount of content in the window, but can be very useful when trying to debug a poorly-performing translation.


### Interpreting the Log Window ###
It can't be emphasized enough that the log window is THE most important place to look for information when a translation does not complete as expected - or to be sure that a translation has completed as expected.

If a translation fails, look in the log window first.
Rejected Features

When a transformer rejects a feature in some way – perhaps it has the wrong type of geometry, for example – it usually writes it to a spatial log file.

Identify bad features using the spatial log (.ffs) dataset. It will probably be easier than trying to locate the feature within the full source dataset.

Here are some tips on interpreting the log file:

#### Check for Warnings
The first thing to do is check for the following comment:

> Translation was SUCCESSFUL with X warning(s)

And then (if X > 0), use the search option to look for the word WARN

#### Sequence
Be aware that — because FME processes data feature-by-feature instead of transformer-by-transformer — the log file does not show each transformer in sequence. Don't be fooled into thinking the order of the log file will absolutely match the layout of the workspace.

#### Output
If the workspace features have been redirected to an output other than a Writer, then this is reported at the very bottom of the log. Watch for such messages. It's easy to miss this and assume that there is a problem with the FME writer.

#### Timestamps
Literally, FME processing time is the amount of time that FME was actively processing. This is not necessarily the same as the length of time taken to run the workspace!

The absolute start and end times often differ from FME processing time because non-FME processes, such as a database query, add to the absolute time taken without adding to the FME processing time.

Therefore the log can provide an indication of the efficiency of external processes; for example, database reading. A slow database read would imply database indexing needs to be improved.

#### Unexpected Input
Unexpected Input is data that is read from a dataset but not used in the workspace. This is reported through a message at the bottom of the log. However, don't automatically assume that there is a definite problem. FME will report this as a warning even if a user deliberately didn't want this data processed.

#### Filtering Rejected Input
Occasionally a transformer or writer will reject certain features because they do not match the functionality or parameters of that object.

For example, if a mixture of point and line features is sent into the AreaBuilder transformer, then the log will report that the point features were discarded.

It will give a tidier log if such features are removed before they get to the point of being a problem. For example, a GeometryFilter would be enough to filter out points before they even get to the AreaBuilder.

 In FME2015 or newer, rejected features are automatically counted on a <Rejected> port, even if there is no Logger or other transformer attached:

Additionally, the rejected features are also saved as a temporary dataset, so right-clicking (or double-clicking) allows the user to inspect them in the Data Inspector, whether or not the features were expected.

 
### Logger Transformer ###
A Logger transformer takes features from the workflow and writes information about them to the log window or log file. Limits can be placed on the number of features to be logged in full.

It is extremely useful for writing out information to the log for debugging purposes.


######***TIP***
*The Logger transformer has a setting called 'Log Message:' – when a feature is logged, this message appears with it. Setting a unique message helps you locate logged features by using the log search function to find the message. FME also adds the transformer name to the message, helping you to identify between multiple Logger transformers.*
