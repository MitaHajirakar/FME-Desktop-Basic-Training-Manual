## Format Methodology ##

Format best practices mostly involve setting up readers and writers in a clear and uncluttered manner in the workspace canvas. 


### Minimizing Feature Type Objects ###

A schema definition may contain many, many Feature Types. If these are all listed separately then the workspace can become extremely unwieldy and poorly laid out.

When creating a workspace you'll be prompted which feature types to add to the canvas. Don't add feature types you don't need, as it will clutter the canvas.


### Minimizing Source Attributes ###

Excessive attributes can also cause workspace clutter. This can be relieved using some functionality to hide (unexpose) unwanted attributes.

This functionality can be found in a Reader Feature Type Properties dialog.

For example, here the user has hidden a number of attributes that are unnecessary for their workspace. Only the required attributes remain exposed:

This makes the source schema, and all transformer dialogs, much clearer and tidier than if the entire set of attributes was still exposed.

Hide any attributes you don't need to use in the translation, as it will make the workspace tidier. Plus, with fewer connections to track, the Workbench canvas will respond faster to edits.


### Format Defaults ###

Each Reader and Writer parameter has a default value when FME is installed.

However, a user may find they always need a different value than the default whenever a new workspace is created. For example, if they always read MicroStation data in the same way (for example they always want to preserve multi-text as a single feature) it would be useful to permanently set the relevant parameters so that they are used by all new workspaces. This can be achieved using the Defaults button at the foot of each Reader/Writer parameters dialog:

Now whenever a specific format is used, the parameters already have predefined defaults.

If you create the same workspace repeatedly, then use the Defaults options to avoid having to enter the same parameter values each time.


### Database Connections ###

For database formats, the main repetition is entering the same connection and authentication parameters whenever a Reader or Writer is added, or when a database connection is required inside a transformer.

That could be solved by using format defaults, but a better method is to use Database Connections, a piece of functionality new to FME2015.

Database Connections are a pre-defined set of connection and authentication parameters, stored under a single name. Once created, all FME Readers and Writers (and transformers) will accept a connection name in lieu of the actual parameters.

Database Connections are created in a dialog opened by selecting Tools > FME Options from the menubar, and then clicking on a Database Connections icon. A new connection is created by clicking the + button:

A new connection is defined by selecting the database type, entering connection parameters, and giving the connection a name:

Now, whenever a workspace involves a database-related Reader/Writer, it's possible to simply use this connection instead of re-entering all the usual parameters:

The benefit here is not only a quicker process - in any workspace you create - but workspaces that you send to other people will be more secure, because they won't include any database authentication details.


######Tip
*If you read from or write to databases on a regular basis, be sure to create database connections to avoid repeatedly entering the same connection and authentication parameters.*

######Warning!
*Obviously workspaces that make use of new functionality like Database Connections are not compatible with previous versions of FME. Therefore don't switch over to Database Connections until you are certain that you are ready to migrate fully to FME2015.*
