# Managing Reader Datasets #
It’s very simple to use a dataset parameter to change the data being read; but care must be taken to avoid certain pitfalls.

## Non-Matching Data ##
As we have seen, each Reader in a workspace contains a parameter with which the source dataset can be selected. Using this parameter it's possible to change a Reader to read a different source dataset (or datasets) than those selected when the workspace was created initially.

This is useful because it allows a workspace author to create a prototype workspace, test it on a single source dataset, and then adjust the workspace to read all source data.

However, it’s important to remember that the original dataset establishes the basis for the Reader schema definition. Problems arise if subsequent datasets do not conform to this original schema.


### Datasets with Different Attributes ###

As already noted, a schema definition includes user attributes. If a Reader is defined with one set of attributes, then made to read datasets with different attributes, there is an obvious conflict.

The problem is that user attributes are fixed in the reader schema, which is why they are grayed-out in the properties dialog.

In fact the attributes are read and attached to incoming features, but since they won’t appear on the writer schema, they will not get written to any output dataset (that requires a dynamic writer).

Furthermore, since the attributes don’t appear in the workspace itself, there is no way for the workspace author to manipulate them with transformers.


### Datasets with Different Feature Types ###
Similarly, a schema includes the definition of a source dataset’s feature types.

If the Reader is defined with one set of feature types, then switched to read datasets with different feature types, then that is another source of conflict.

Again, the problem lies in having a fixed source schema, where feature types are not automatically updated when new data is read.

In this scenario the data is automatically discarded; i.e. Reader feature types defined in the workspace act as a type of filter through which incoming data must pass.
