## Feature Counts ##
A workspace Feature Count refers to the numbers shown on each connection once a translation is complete:

When a log file shows a translation that ended in an error or where the number of output features was not what was expected, then the Feature Count values shown on each connection can help to diagnose where the error occurred.

For example, if all your features entered a transformer, but none emerged, then you can be fairly confident that the transformer is the cause of the problem. You might check that the correct transformer output port is connected, or add a Logger or Inspector transformer before it so that you can examine what data is going in and determine why it is being lost.

Here, for example, 100 features are entering the Clipper transformer (to be clipped against a single boundary) but none emerge.

Maybe this is because the wrong output port is connected and the data falls outside the clip boundary and not inside. If this itself would be a problem, then inspect the data as it enters the transformer. In this example it's likely that Clipper and Clippees don't occupy the same coordinate system, hence one does not fall inside the other.


### Single Feature Counts ###
When a workspace fails (usually with an ERROR) and only a single feature has emerged from a transformer, it is likely to be the following transformer that is the cause of the problem:

Here, for example, 100 features enter the StatisticsCalculator and only 1 emerges. However, the StatisticsCalculator is not the source of the error. The error is triggered when the first feature exits the StatisticsCalculator and reaches the VertexCreator, suggesting the VertexCreator is the problem here. It failed before the other 99 features had the chance to even reach it.

######***TIP***
*Use Feature counts to identify where a problem occurred.*

######***TIP***
*You should also be clear that these numbers don't work as well for identifying warnings. Most warnings still allow the feature in question to pass, unprocessed, so the counts do not reflect warnings as well as they reflect errors that stop the translation in its failed state.*

*However, all ports labelled <Rejected> will have a count of features, whether or not they are connected to further transformers.*
