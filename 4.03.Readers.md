## Readers ##
***Readers*** are the main components that read data in FME.

A Reader is the FME term for the component in a translation that reads a source dataset. A Reader reads a single format of data, but can read any number of datasets in that format.

When a workspace is generated with the Generate Workspace dialog then it is created with just a single Reader (and a single Writer). However, this does not mean the workspace is forever limited to this. Additional Readers can be added to a workspace at any time, any number of formats can be used, and there does not need to be an equal number of Readers and Writers.

For example, the Navigator window shows this workspace contains 25 Readers and 32 Writers of all data types and formats!


### Adding a Reader ###
Adding a Reader to a workspace is a common requirement. There are several reasons:

- The Generate Workspace dialog only adds a single Reader
- Each Reader handles only one format of data
- Different datasets (of the same format) may require reading with different parameters

Therefore the need to read multiple formats of data – such as Smallworld, DXF, and Geodatabase – requires multiple Readers.

Additional Readers are added to a translation using Readers>Add Reader from the menubar.

Adding a Reader has this effect on the hierarchy diagram:

Although the usual workflow is to create a new workspace with the Generate dialog and then add extra components as necessary, there’s nothing to prevent a user starting with an empty workspace and simply adding Readers (and Writers) one-by-one.


### Removing a Reader ###
Not only can you add a new Reader, you can remove an existing one; for example when you have an old Reader whose input you no longer need. Tools exist to remove a Reader from a workspace, both on the menubar and in context menus in the Navigator window.
