# Structural Transformation
Transforming a dataset’s structure requires knowledge of *schemas* and how to use FME to manipulate them.
 
## Schema Concepts
A ***schema*** is the structure of a dataset or, more accurately, a formal definition of a dataset’s structure. FME uses the term ‘schema’, but you may know this as 'data model'.

Each dataset has its own unique schema; it includes layers, geometries, attributes, and other rules that define or restrict its content.


### Schema Representation
When a new workspace is created, FME scans the source datasets and creates a visual representation of its schema on the left side of the workspace canvas. 

On the right side of the canvas, FME creates a representation of how this schema will be duplicated in the chosen destination format.

The workspace therefore reads from left to right.

### Feature Type Schemas
A schema is not just represented as a set of layers on the Workbench canvas; for example, each different layer in a dataset can have a different structure. 

This part of the schema is revealed by clicking the cog-wheel icon on the canvas object representing that layer.

This opens the Feature Type Properties dialog. This dialog represents schema under a number of tabbed tables.

Under the General tab there is the name of the feature type, in this case PostalAddress.

Allowed geometry types and the name of the parent dataset for the feature types are shown as well.

The User Attributes tab shows a list of attributes. Each attribute is defined by its name, data type, width, and number of decimal places.

### What We Want
All of this information goes to make up the Reader and Writer schema. 

The Reader schema represents 'what we have'; FME's view of the source datasets. The Writer schema represents 'what we want'; the data required by the user.

If 'what we want' is different to the default schema in FME, we simply have to change it using ***Schema Editing***.

##### *TIP*
*FME supports 300+ formats and there are almost as many terms for the way data is subdivided. The most common terms are layer, table, class, category, level, or object.*

*The general FME term for these subdivisions is Feature Type, and that is what we will use throughout the manual.*

*Be aware though, that all dialogs in FME Workbench use format-specific terminology. So, screenshots in the manual may display different terms depending on what format of data is being used!*
