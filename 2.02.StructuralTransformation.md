# Structural Transformation
Transforming a dataset’s structure requires knowledge of schemas and how to use FME to manipulate them.
 
## Schema Concepts

A ***schema*** is the structure of a dataset or, more accurately, a formal definition of a dataset’s structure. The term Data Model may be more familiar, but at Safe Software we stick to the term ‘schema’.

Each dataset has its own unique schema that includes feature types (layers), geometries, attributes, and other rules that define or restrict its content.

### How Does FME Represent Schemas?

When a new workspace is created, FME scans all of the source datasets. From this it creates a visual representation of the data’s schema on the left side of the canvas. 

On the right side, it creates a visual representation of how this schema will be duplicated in the chosen output format.

Here are source and destination schemas as they are represented in Workbench.

Each object on the canvas is a separate Feature Type within a dataset.

The workspace reads from left to right.

At this point, the Reader schema represents 'what we have'; that is, FME's view of the source datasets. The Writer schema represents 'what we want'; the data required by the user.

By default, the Writer schema is a mirror image of the source; differences only occur when demanded by limitations of the selected destination format. This allows Quick Translation to occur with no further editing of the translation by the user.


### Viewing the Schema in FME Workbench

A schema goes beyond what can be seen on the workspace canvas; there are other components that also represent the structure of a dataset.

Some parts of the schema relate specifically to a single feature type only. Attributes are one such component. These components are shown in the Properties dialog of a feature type.

The Properties dialog is opened by clicking the Properties Browse button at the right side of the feature type.

The Feature Type Properties dialog has a number of tabs that show information.

Under the General tab there is the name of the feature type, in this case PostalAddress.

Allowed geometry types and the name of the parent dataset for the feature types are shown as well.

***NEW** FME 2015 dialogs have been updated with format-specific terminology. That is, the term "Feature Type" is automatically replaced with the appropriate term for the current format. In the previous screenshot a label states "Feature Class or Table Name" because the format is a Geodatabase. If the format were AutoCAD (for example) then the label would state "Layer Name."*

The User Attributes tab shows a list of attributes. Each attribute is defined by its name, data type, width, and number of decimal places.

This example shows a Reader feature type. You may find these greyed out by default, since source attributes cannot be edited because they represent the physical schema of the data. If they were changed, the schema would no longer match the Reader dataset.

***TIP** The Data Type column for an attribute shows only values that match the permitted types for that data format. For example, an Oracle schema permits attribute types of varchar or clob. MapInfo does not support these data types so they would never appear in a MapInfo schema.*
