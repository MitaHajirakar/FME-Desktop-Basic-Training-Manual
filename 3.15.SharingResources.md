## Sharing Resources ##
Re-using components, and sharing them with fellow FME users, is vital in creating consistent designs among a large group of employees. It also improves efficiency – because a translation author will not have to create every workspace from the beginning – and reliability, because any change to a shared resource is passed on through any workspaces that make use of it.

Resources that may be shared include workspaces, custom transformers, custom formats, custom coordinate systems, and templates.

### Shared Resource Folders ###

The basic method of sharing is through a Shared Resource Folder. FME is able to identify resources stored in these folders, and use them directly within a translation.

A shared resource folder can be used by just one person, or many.

Using a shared folder is as simple as defining it using Tools > FME Options > Default Paths.

By specifying a location in this option, FME automatically searches for and uses any shared resources that are stored in this folder.

######***TIP***
*Use a shared folder on your network as a shared resource folder when you have several FME authors who all need access to the same resources.*

*<user\>/<documents\>/<FME\> is a shared resource folder created and used by default, without having to define it within the options dialog.*
