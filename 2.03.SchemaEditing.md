# Schema Editing

As noted, initially the Writer schema in a workspace is a mirror image of the source. However, in many cases the user requires the output to have a different data structure.

Schema Editing is the process of altering the destination schema to customize the structure of the output data. One good example is renaming an attribute field in the output. After editing, the source schema still represents ‘what we have’, but the destination schema now truly does represent 'what we want.'

## Editable Components
There are a number of edits that can be performed, including, but not limited to the following.

### Attribute Renaming
Attributes on the destination schema can be renamed, such as renaming POSTALCODE to PSTLCODE.

To rename an attribute open the Feature Type Properties dialog and click the User Attributes tab. Click the attribute to be renamed and enter the new name.

### Attribute Type Changes
Any attribute on the writer schema can have a change of type; for example, changing STATUS from a character field to a number field.

To change an attribute type open the Feature Type Properties dialog and click the User Attributes tab. Use the Data Type field to change the type of an attribute.

### Feature Type Renaming
To rename a destination feature type (for example, rename PostalAddress to Addresses) open the Feature Type Properties dialog. Click the General tab. Click in the Feature Type Name field and edit the name as required.

### Geometry Type Changes
To change the permitted geometry for a feature type, (for example, change the permitted geometries from lines to points) open the Feature Type Properties dialog. Click the General tab. Choose from the list of permitted geometries.

This field is only available where the format requires a decision on geometry type.
