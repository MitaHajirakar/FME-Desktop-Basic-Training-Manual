## Transformer Methodology ##

As part of the business of creating translations, there are a number of ways to use FME in an efficient and skillful manner. Some of these apply specifically to the use of transformers.

### The Right Transformer ###
Although there are usually several ways to achieve the same goal with different transformers, the methods are not always equally efficient. It’s important not to assume that the first way is the best way.

If a workspace duplicates the same transformer again, and again – or divides data up into multiple streams to process it only slightly differently – then it is probable that the workspace has been designed very inefficiently.

The multiple attribute transformers here indicate there is a problem.

######TIP
*If you’re unsure as to what transformer to use, or are worried that your workspace has multiple streams of data for no good reason, then consult other users in the FME community, or the Safe Software support team.*

*In the above example, a single AttributeValueMapper transformer could be used to replace all of the above transformers.*


### Default Values ###
As with reader and writer dialogs, transformer parameter dialogs also possess a button to set the current values as future defaults.

In this parameters dialog for the AreaBuilder transformer, the Defaults button is highlighted.

By entering a set of values and saving them as the current defaults, each newly placed instance of this transformer inherits the same parameter values.

### Multi-Workspace Translations ###
Although FME has the capability to run one workspace from another – using the WorkspaceRunner transformer – this is designed for the specific situation of batch processing.

In most other cases a user should never need to split a translation over two or more workspaces.

######TIP
*If you’re in a situation that requires the use of two workspaces to carry out one translation, then reconsider your decision and consult other FME users for advice.*


### Workspace Scale ###
You might have noticed view tools for zooming in and out of a workspace, but did you know that there is a default zoom scale (100%) at which transformer are shown in “actual size”?

To revert to this optimum zoom level you can either drag the scale bar to 100% or double-click anywhere on the scale bar.

######TIP
*Working with a 100% zoom is the optimum scale for viewing FME canvas objects.*
