## Controlling Readers ##
Reader parameters are those that control how data is read.

Because these parameters refer to specific components and characteristics of the related format, no two formats will have the same set of control parameters.

### Reader Parameters ###
Reader parameters are shown and set in the Navigator Window. You expose the list of parameters by clicking on the expand arrow icons to the left of the Reader.

For ease-of-use, basic parameters are listed first, then the remainder are divided into a number of sections: Advanced, Search Envelope, and Features to Read.

In general, basic parameters are the ones used most often; advanced parameters a little less so. Search Envelope parameters relate to the geographic area of data to be read, and Features to Read parameters give control over how many features will be read and from which layers.

To edit a parameter, double-click it. A dialog opens up where the parameter’s value may be set.
