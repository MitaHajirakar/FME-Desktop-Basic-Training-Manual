Because noise control laws are being amended in the City of Interopolis, residents living in a single-family residence within 50 metres of a major highway must be contacted to inform them of these changes.

It is your task to find all affected residential addresses.

**1) Start Workbench**
<br>Start Workbench and create a new empty workspace.


**2) Add Reader (Address data)**
<br>Use Readers > Add Reader to add a reader for address data:

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Esri Geodatabase (File Geodb API)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\Addresses\Addresses.gdb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Parameters</td>
<td style="">Table List: PostalAddress</td>
</tr>

</table>


**3) Add Reader (Zoning data)**
<br>Use Readers > Add Reader to add a reader for zoning data. The zoning data will be used to determine whether an address is single-family residential or not.

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">MapInfo TAB (MITAB)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\Zoning\Zones.tab</td>
</tr>

</table>


**4) Add Reader (Roads data)**
<br>Use Readers > Add Reader to add a Reader for the roads data. The roads data will be used to determine distance from an arterial route.

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Autodesk AutoCAD DWG/DXF</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>

</tr>

When prompted, select only the feature type (layer) called Arterial. The workspace will now look like this:

X

Don't forget to inspect all of the source data to familiarize yourself with the contents.


**5) Add Tester Transformer**
<br>Add a Tester transformer to the Zoning feature type.

This Tester will be used to filter residential zones from the other zoning areas.
All single-family residential zones will start with RS, so the Tester should be set up like this:

X

The important thing is to set up the tests using the “Begins With” predicate.


**6) Add SpatialFilter**
<br>Add a SpatialFilter transformer to the workspace. This will be used to test each address to show whether that address falls inside one of the filtered residential zones.

Connect the feature type PostalAddress to the SpatialFilter:Candidate port
Connect the Tester:Passed output to the SpatialFilter:Filterport

X


**7) Set up SpatialFilter**
<br>Open the SpatialFilter parameters dialog. Set up the parameters.
Tests to Perform should be set to 'Contains' (i.e. find addresses that the zones contain). The Filter Type should be set to Multiple Filters (as there are multiple zoning areas). However, the Pass Criteria parameter should be “Pass Against One Filter.”

This parameter is very important. The test will fail if it is not set correctly, as a single address cannot be in ALL zones.

X


**8) Add Inspectors**
<br>Now let's test what we have so far. Add Inspectors to both SpatialFilter output ports, and the Tester:Passed port.


**9) Save and Run Workspace**
<br>Save the workspace. Run the workspace. Inspect the output to prove that it has worked as expected. The only area features will be the residential zones, and SpatialFilter:Passed features will fall inside these areas.


**10) Add Bufferer**
<br>Now we can determine which of the filtered addresses fall within 50 metres of an arterial route.

The SpatialFilter does not have a test for "within X distance" therefore we'll have to set that up a little differently. Add a Bufferer transformer to the workspace. Connect it to the Arterial roadsdata:

X

Now open the parameters dialog for the Bufferer. Set the buffer amount to be 50.


######TIP
*Optionally you can add a Dissolver transformer after the Bufferer, to merge all the buffer features together. The output will be the same (in terms of addresses
selected) but it will look nicer in the FME Data Inspector.*


**11) Add SpatialFilter**
<br>Add a second SpatialFilter transformer. The buffered arterial routes are the Filter. The prefiltered addresses are theCandidates:

X

As before, open the parameters dialog and change the settings to be a 'Contains' test against multiple filters.


**12) Run Workspace**
<br>Attach some Inspector transformers to show you the output from various transformers. Save and run the workspace. The output (zoomed in) should look like this:

X


**Congratulations!**

You have now used filter transformers to filter data depending on different sets of conditions.
