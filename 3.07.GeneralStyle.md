## General Style Suggestions ##
These items are general suggestions for what the style of an FME workspace should look like.

### Transformer Layout ###
The layout of transformers – and, in particular, a consistent method of positioning – can really make the difference between a poorly-designed workspace and one that is visually attractive and efficient.

Try to line up objects where possible and use the minimum of backwards-pointing connections (those that go from right to left):

Using straight connection lines between objects – rather than crooked - is one way to enhance the look of any workspace.

Some users prefer to add extra vertices to connections to square them off.

Try to avoid adding extra vertices to a connection line, because their behavior is unpredictable when you move one of the attached transformers.

Objects in a stack - particularly feature types - are easier on the eye when vertically aligned.


### Grid and Guides ###
FME2015 introduces new functionality to help align workspace objects in a neat and tidy way. This functionality is accessed through View > Grid and Guides on the Workbench menubar.

The Grid and Guides dialog has options for turning on these functions, and for adjusting their exact parameters.

Show Grid causes a grid of lines to be displayed on the Workbench canvas. Snap to Grid causes all objects - such as the summary annotation highlighted - to snap onto the intersection of grid lines. In this way objects can be more easily lined up.

Show Guides causes guidelines to be displayed on the Workbench canvas whenever an object is moved, and lines up approximately to another canvas object. Snap to Guides allows an object to be snapped onto a highlighted guideline.

These two tools make it very simple for workspace objects to be aligned in a pleasing style.



### Non-Overlapping Connections ###
Does it really need to be said that overlapping lines are not good for workspace clarity?

Take the effort to tidy your workspace. It will be so much clearer with just a little reorganization.


### Renamed Transformers ###
Remember that the Properties dialog for a transformer contains a field where the transformer may be renamed to a more meaningful title.

Rename transformers to help identify them both on the canvas and in the navigator window.
