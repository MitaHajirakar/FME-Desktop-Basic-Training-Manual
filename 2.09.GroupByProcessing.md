# Group-By Processing #
Group-By parameters are an important tool for effective FME data transformations.

 
## What is a Group? ##
FME transformers can carry out transformations on either one feature at a time, or on a whole set of features at once.

For example, the AreaCalculator transformer operates on one feature at a time (to measure the area of that one polygon feature).

The StatisticsCalculator is called a group-based transformer; it operates on multiple features at a time (to calculate an average value for them all).

In FME we call this set of features a ***group***. 


## Creating Groups ##
By default a group-based transformer treats ALL the features that it is fed as a single group.

However, such transformers also have a ***Group-By*** parameter. This parameter lets the user define several groups based upon the value of an attribute.

Here, a LineOnLineOverlayer transformer is being used to intersect a number of line features.

The selected Group-By attribute is name.

The result is a series of groups for overlaying where the features in each group share the same value for name.

The practical outcome is that intersection will only take place on line features with the same name.
