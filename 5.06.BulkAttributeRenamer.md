## BulkAttributeRenamer ##
This transformer carries out the core function of the AttributeRenamer; renaming attributes. But instead of manually specifying each attribute, this transformer lets the user enter a string-matching expression in order to define which attributes to rename.

This transformer is very powerful as it can carry out a number of renaming actions. These are:

- Add String Prefix
- Add String Suffix
- Remove Prefix String
- Remove Suffix String
- Regular Expression Replace
- String Replace
- Case Change

The power of the transformer is also in its ability to manipulate multiple attributes at once, without having to individually select them all.

It can be particularly useful when the incoming data has a prefix or suffix on the attribute names that needs to be removed, or (like here) when all the incoming attributes are mixed/lowercase and need to be UPPER case on the output.
