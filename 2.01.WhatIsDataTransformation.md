# What is Data Transformation?
**Data Transformation** is FME's ability to manipulate data. 

The transformation step occurs during the process of format translation. Data is read, transformed, and then written to the new format.

## Data Transformation Types
Data transformation can be subdivided into two distinct types: Structural Transformation and Content Transformation.

### Structural Transformation

This type of transformation is perhaps better called ‘reorganization'. It refers to the ability of FME to channel data from source to destination in an almost infinite number of arrangements. This includes the ability to merge data, divide data, re-order data, and define custom data structures.

Transforming the structure of a dataset is carried out by manipulating its schema.

### Content Transformation

This type of transformation is perhaps better called ‘revision'. It refers to the ability to alter the substance of a dataset. Manipulating a feature's geometry or attribute values is the best example of how FME can transform content.

Content transformation can take place independently or alongside structural transformation.
