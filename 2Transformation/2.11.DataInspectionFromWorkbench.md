# Data Inspection Using FME Workbench #
Besides Redirect to FME Data Inspector, Workbench can route data to the FME Data Inspector from individual transformers.

 
## Using an Inspector Transformer ##
An ***Inspector*** is a Workbench transformer – with its own distinctive look and style – that causes data entering it to be directed to FME Data Inspector.

An Inspector transformer differs from the Redirect to FME Data Inspector setting because the transformer can be applied at any point in a translation (not just at the very end) and does not prevent the data being output to the writer. It also lets a user be more selective about which features should be inspected.

Here data is being directed to the Inspector after a CenterPointReplacer transformer, but before a KMLStyler.

## Placing an Inspector Transformer ##
The best, and simplest way to apply an Inspector is to right-click the output port of an object in Workbench and select the Connect Inspector option.

Here the user right-clicks the Output port of an AttributeManager and chooses the option Connect Inspector.

Notice that the Inspector is named automatically using the transformer and output port names. Here it will be "AttributeManager_Output". This helps to identify the data from this Inspector (as opposed to any others) in the FME Data Inspector.

Note that the Inspector transformer only opens the FME Data Inspector when there are features to view. If there are zero features, then the Data Inspector will not open!
