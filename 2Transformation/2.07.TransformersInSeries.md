# Transformers used in Series #
Much like a set of components in an electrical circuit, a series of Workbench Transformers can be connected together to have a cumulative effect on a set of data.

 
## Chaining Transformers ##
Even with the large number of transformers available in FME, users frequently need a combination or chain of transformers instead of a single one.

A string of transformers that graphically represent an overall workflow is a key concept of FME.

In this example, a DuplicateRemover transformer removes duplicate polygon features. A Dissolver transformer merges each remaining (unique) polygon with its neighbor where there is a common boundary. Finally each merged area gains an ID number from the Counter transformer.
