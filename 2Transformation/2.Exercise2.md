The team responsible for maintaining parks and other grassed areas needs to know the area and facilities of each park in order to plan their budget for the upcoming year. You are to use FME to provide a dataset of this information.

We’ll now continue the previous example by filtering out dog parks from the source data (as these have a different scale of maintenance costs) and write them to the log window. We'll also handle the renamed attribute NeighborhoodName.


**1) Start FME Workbench**</br>
Start FME Workbench and open the workspace from Exercise 2a. Alternatively you can open
C:\FMEData2015\Workspaces\DesktopBasic\Example2b-Begin.fmw.


**2) Add Transformer**</br>
Let's first handle the source attribute NeighborhoodName, which was renamed Neighborhood on the writer but not yet connected. 

We could do this by simply drawing a connection, but it's generally better to use a transformer called the AttributeRenamer.

Therefore click on the feature connection from Reader to Writer feature type:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.34.WorkspaceSelectedConnection.jpg)

Start to type the phrase "AttributeRenamer." This is how we can place a transformer in the workspace. As you type, FME searches for a matching transformer. When the list is short enough for you to see the AttributeRenamer, select it from the dialog:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.35.QuickAddAttributeRenamer.jpg)

This will place an AttributeRenamer transformer like so:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.36.AttributeRenamerInTranslation.jpg)

Notice that the parameters button is colored red because there are parameters that need to be set for this transformer.


**3) Set Parameters**</br>
Click the parameters button on the AttributeRenamer transformer to open the parameters dialog. It will look like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.37.AttributeRenamerDialog.jpg)

In the Old Attribute field, click in the field, click on the drop down arrow, and from the list that is revealed choose NeighborhoodName as the attribute to rename.

In the New Attribute field, repeat the process but instead choose Neighborhood. The dialog will now look like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.38.AttributeRenamerDialogFilledIn.jpg)

Click OK to close the dialog. Now in the Workbench canvas window you will see the Neighborhood attribute is flagged with a green arrow, to confirm that a value is being provided to that attribute.


**4) Add Transformer**</br>
Now we should remove dog parks from the data, because these have their own set of costs.

This can be done with a Tester transformer. Click on the connection from the AttributeRenamer output port to the ParksMaintenanceData feature type on the Writer.

Start typing the word Tester. When you spot the Tester transformer click on it to add one to the workspace. The workspace will now look like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.39.TesterRedFlagInWorkspace.jpg)

Notice that the Passed output port is the one connected by default.


**5) Set Parameters**</br>
Click the parameters button on the Tester transformer to open the parameters dialog. Double click in the Left Value field and from there click the down arrow and choose Attribute Value > DogPark.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.40.TesterDialogSelectingAttribute.jpg)

For the operator choose the equals sign (=) and for the Right Value click into the field and type the value N.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.41.TesterDialogCompletedTest.jpg)

Click OK to accept the values and close the dialog.

**6) Add Transformer**</br>
We are now filtering out dog parks from our data, using a test on an attribute value. The question is, what should we do with this data we have filtered out. There are many things we could do, but for now we'll simply log the information to the FME log window.

To do this, right-click on the Tester Failed port and choose the option Connect Logger:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.42.ConnectLoggerContextMenu.jpg)

A Logger transformer will be added to the workspace. This will record all incoming features to the log window:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FMEEvangelist/FME-Desktop-Basic-Training-Manual-Images/master/Img2.43.LoggerInWorkspace.jpg)

Loggers inserted by this method are named after – and reported in the log with – the output port they are connected to, here Tester_Failed.


**7) Run Workspace**</br>
Save and run the workspace. It is not yet complete but running it will prove that everything is working correctly up to this point.


######Advanced
As an advanced task, if you have time, filter the data further to remove parks that do not have a name; i.e. their name attribute is missing or empty. Would you need to place a second Tester transformer, or could you incorporate the test into the existing one?


Congratulations! You have now:
> Carried out schema mapping with the AttributeRenamer transformer
> 
> Filtered data using the Tester transformer
> 
> Recorded data with the Logger transformer
