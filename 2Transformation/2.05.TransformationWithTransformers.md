# Transformation with Transformers #

Besides Schema Editing and Schema Mapping, transformation can be carried out using objects called ***transformers***.

## What is a Transformer? ##

As the name suggests, a transformer is an FME Workbench object that carries out transformation of features. There are lots of FME transformers, each of which carry out many different operations.

Transformers are connected somewhere between the Reader and Writer feature types, so that data flows from the Reader, through a transformation process, and on to the Writer.

Transformers usually appear in the canvas window as rectangular, light-blue objects.


## Transformer Parameters ##
Each transformer may have a number of parameters – also known as settings. Access the settings by clicking the Properties button at the top right of each transformer.

## Color-Coded Properties Buttons ##
The Properties button on a transformer is color-coded to reflect the status of the settings.

A blue Properties button indicates that the default transformer settings have been checked and amended as required, and that the transformer is ready to use.

A yellow Properties button indicates that the default settings have not yet been checked. The transformer can be used in this state, but the results may be unpredictable.

A red Properties button indicates that there is at least one setting for which FME cannot supply a default value. The setting must be provided with a value before the transformer can be used.

## Transformer Ports ##
Far from having just a single input and/or output, a transformer can have multiple input ports, multiple output ports, or both.

This Counter transformer has a single input and output port.

This Clipper has multiple input and output ports. Notice too that not all of them are – or need to be – connected.

This Inspector has just a single input port...

…whereas this Creator has only a single output port!
