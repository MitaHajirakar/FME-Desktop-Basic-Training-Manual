## Writer Feature Type Parameters ##
Just like Writers, Writer feature types have their own set of parameters that control how that feature type (layer/table) is being written. These parameters appear under the Format Parameters tab in the Feature Type Properties dialog:

The important thing is that these (feature type) parameters only apply to a single feature type, whereas a Writer parameter would apply to all feature types.

For example, when writing to a SQL Server database there is a feature type parameter that defines the spatial index to create.

This is a Feature Type parameter because not every table might require a spatial index; therefore each feature type needs a way to define it.

Conversely, there is no password parameter at the feature type level because authentication applies to the entire database, not the individual tables. Those would be Reader parameters.

So feature type parameters provide a degree of individual control over writing different layers or tables.

NB: Not all feature types need a set of parameters, so the Format Parameters tab is not always present.
