# Managing Attributes #
A high proportion of the top 25 transformers are support transformers for managing attributes. These create new attributes, rename them, set values, and delete them.

A key use for these transformers is to rename attributes for the purpose of schema mapping.
Attribute Managing Transformers

The key transformers for managing attributes are these:

- AttributeCreator
- AttributeRenamer (and BulkAttributeRenamer)
- AttributeCopier
- AttributeRemover (and BulkAttributeRemover)
- AttributeKeeper
- AttributeExposer

Many of these transformers can carry out similar operations. In fact, with the AttributeCreator and AttributeRenamer transformers having the widest range of functionality, some users may use these two attribute-related transformers to the exclusion of most others.


## Lists ##
A List in FME is a mechanism that allows multiple values per attribute.

For example, the attribute myAttribute can only contain a single value.

However, the list attribute myList{}.myAttribute can contain multiple values as:

<pre>myList{0}.myAttribute
myList{1}.myAttribute
myList{2}.myAttribute
etc.</pre>

There are various transformers designed to operate specifically on lists - they can be found in the Lists category of the transformer gallery - and list functionality is built into other transformers (such as the AttributeCreator) too.
