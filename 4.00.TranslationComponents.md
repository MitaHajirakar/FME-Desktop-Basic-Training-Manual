# Translation Components #
An FME translation is made up of a number of different components.

For each component there are tools within FME to create, add, or remove them; and parameters in Workbench in order to control them.

In particular, each component has very specific terminology applied to it, and itâ€™s useful to have a full understanding of this terminology, especially when working with multiple datasets.
