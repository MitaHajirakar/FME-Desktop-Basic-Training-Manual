## Controlling Writers ##

Writer parameters are those that control how data is written.

Because these parameters refer to specific components and characteristics of the related format, no two formats will have the same set of control parameters.


### Writer Parameters ###

Writer parameters are shown and set in the Navigator Window. You expose the list of parameters by clicking on the expand arrow icons to the left of the Writer.

For ease-of-use, basic parameters are listed first, and then advanced parameters are hidden under a separate section.

In general, basic parameters are the ones used most often; advanced parameters a little less so. To edit a parameter, double-click it. A dialog opens up where the parameterâ€™s value may be set.
