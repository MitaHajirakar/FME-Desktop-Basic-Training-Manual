# Practical Transformer Use #
Even experienced FME users find the full list of transformers a daunting sight. In this section you’ll learn to stop worrying and love the transformer gallery.

With over four hundred (400) transformers FME possesses a lot of functionality; probably a lot more than a new user realizes, and much of which would be very useful to them. This section helps find the transformer you need, even if you didn’t realize you needed it.

Although the transformer list can look a bit overwhelming, don't panic! The reality is that most users focus on 20-30 transformers that are relevant to their day-to-day workflow. You don't need to know every single transformer to use FME effectively.


## Transformer Gallery ##
The transformer gallery is the obvious place to start looking for transformers. There are a number of ways in which transformers here can be located.

## Transformer Categories ##
Transformer categories are a good starting point from which to explore the transformer list. Transformers are grouped in categories to help find a transformer relevant to the problem at hand.

Notice that in FME 2015 each category now lists the number of transformers that it contains!

Important categories include:

- Calculators: Calculate a value and supply it as a new attribute
- Database: Interact with external databases
- Filters: Split and re-route data
- Geometric Operators: Process feature geometry
- Infrastructure: Structural transformation and scripting with Tcl/Python
- Lists: Work with list attributes
- Rasters: Work with raster datasets
- Strings: Create, modify and delete string (character) attributes
- Stylers: Prepare features for output to particular formats
- Surfaces: Work with surfaces; for example, create contours
- Web Services: Communicate with web services using HTTP
- Workflow: Run workspaces either locally or on an FME Server
- XML: Transformers that deal with bringing XML data into FME

Simply click on the expand button to show all transformers within a particular category.
Transformer Help

The Help window in Workbench displays information about transformers from the FME documentation.

The Transformer Gallery is directly linked to the Help window - that is, a transformer selected in the gallery triggers help contents to display in the Help window.

Another useful piece of documentation is the FME Transformer Reference Guide, which can be found on our web site.
