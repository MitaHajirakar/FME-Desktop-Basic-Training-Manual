In this example, imagine that you are a GIS technician working for a city planning department. The team responsible for maintaining parks and other grassed areas needs to know the area and facilities of each park in order to plan their budget for the upcoming year. You are to use FME to provide a dataset of this information.

The parks team has decided that they do not want the average area of park for the city as a whole. Instead they want the average size of park in each neighborhood.

**1) Start Workbench**</br>
Start Workbench (if necessary) and open the workspace from Exercise 2d. Alternatively you can open C:\FMEData2015\Workspaces\DesktopBasic\Exercise2eBegin.fmw


**2) Set Group-By in StatisticsCalculator**</br>
This is a really simple task to do. Open the parameters dialog for the StatisticsCalculator transformer.

Click the 'browse' button next to the Group By parameter.

Select the attribute called Neighborhood and click OK until all dialogs are closed.

**3) Run the Workspace**</br>
Save and then run the workspace.

Inspect the output data in the Table View window of the FME Data Inspector.

You should see that each neighborhood now has its own value for AverageParkArea:
