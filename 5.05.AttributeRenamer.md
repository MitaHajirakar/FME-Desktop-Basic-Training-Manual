## AttributeRenamer ##
This is a comprehensive transformer that can be used to do many tasks, including:

- Renaming an existing attribute
- Renaming an existing attribute and setting a new value for it
- Manually creating a new Attribute (and setting a value)
- Deleting an attribute


### Rename an Attribute ###
The fundamental purpose of this transformer is to select an attribute and manually enter a new name for it. The old attribute is removed and replaced with the newly named one.

Provided the Default Value field is left empty, the new attribute will take the value of the old one.

This is obviously of most use when wanting to read data that has one schema (set of attribute names) and write it to a dataset that needs a different schema.

### Rename and Set an Attribute ###
A field in the parameters dialog allows the user to set a default value. This way an attribute can be renamed, and a new value defined for it, simultaneously.

### Manually Create (and Set) an Attribute ###

Entering an attribute name into the New Attribute field, without selecting an Old Attribute, means a new attribute is created; substituting for the AttributeCreator.

Entering an attribute name into the Default Value field when a new attribute is created effectively creates the attribute and sets a value for it in one operation. Every feature gets the same attribute with the same value. Again, this can be used as a substitute for the AttributeCreator.

### Delete an Attribute ###
By selecting an Old Attribute, but leaving the New Attribute field empty, the old attribute will be deleted.
