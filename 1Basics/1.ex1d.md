In this exercise, imagine that you are a GIS technician working for a city planning department.

The local tourist bureau is running a promotion where they provide tourists with a GPS device to help them visit street food vendors in the city. You have been asked to produce the data to be used in this scheme.


**1) Start FME Workbench**</br>
Start FME Workbench. In the Getting Started section of the Start window, choose the option to Generate Workspace. When prompted generate a translation with the following parameters:

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Esri Geodatabase (File Geodb API)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Data\CommunityMapping\CommunityMap.gdb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Format</td>
<td style="">GPS eXchange Format (GPX)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2015\Output\Training\FoodVendors.gpx</td>
</tr>

</table>

Click OK to accept the parameters. When prompted which tables to use from the source data (there are several) deselect all tables except for FoodVendors and click OK to create the workspace.

**2) Connect Reader/Writer**</br>
When first created, the Reader and Writer are not connected in this workspace. Connect them by dragging a connection from the output port of the Reader to the input port of the Writer object labelled WayPoint:

Click the expand buttons on the two objects to expose the list of attributes on each:

Now drag a connection between the Reader attribute VendorName and the Writer attribute name. Repeat the process for VendorDescription and desc:

The technique of connecting objects like this is called Schema Mapping, and we shall learn more about it later.


**3) Run Workspace**</br>
Save the workspace so you have a copy of it, then run the workspace by pressing the green play button. The workspace will run and the data written to a Garmin POI dataset.

**4) Inspect Data**</br>
Right-click on the Writer object in the Workbench canvas. Choose the option to Inspect.

This will open the dataset in the FME Data Inspector, where you can verify it is all correct.


**5) Filter Data**</BR>
All this talk of food is making you hungry. It must be lunchtime. To find somewhere to get a quick lunch filter the data to show hot dog vendors in the city.

Congratulations! You have now...
