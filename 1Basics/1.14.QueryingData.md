## Inspecting Data ##
THE FME Data Inspector includes several querying tools, but in particular:

- Query individual feature(s)
- Measure a distance within a View window

The query tool button is like a toggle. By default it is active when you start the FME Data Inspector; if you click it again - or select a windowing tool - you turn the query tool off. 

The results of a feature query are shown in the Feature Information window.

### Feature Information Window ###
The upper part reports on general information about the feature; which feature type (layer) it belongs to, which coordinate system it is in, whether it is two- or three-dimensional, and how many vertices it possesses.

The middle part reports the attributes associated with the feature. This includes user attributes and format attributes (for example fme_type).

The lower part reports the geometry of the feature. It includes the geometry type and a list of the coordinates that go to make up the feature.

### Table View Window ###
Also available is a window called the Table View.

The table view is a way to inspect data in a tabular, spreadsheet-like, layout. Although it does not have the same depth of information shown by the Information Window, the Table View is particularly useful for inspecting the attribute values of multiple features simultaneously.
