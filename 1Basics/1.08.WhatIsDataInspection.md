# Introduction to Data Inspection #

To ensure that you're dealing with the right information you need a clear view of your data at every stage of the transformation process. Data Inspection meets this need: it is the act of viewing data for verification and debugging purposes, before, during, or after a translation.

## What Can Be Inspected? ##
A number of different facets to spatial data may be inspected, including the following:

- **Geometry**: Is the geometry in the correct spatial location? Are the geometry types correct?
- **Symbology**: Is the color, size, and style of each feature correct?
- **Attributes**: Are all the required attributes present? Are all integrity rules being followed?
- **Format**: Is the data in the expected format?
- **Schema**: Is the data subdivided into the correct layers, categories or classes?
- **Quantity**: Does the data contain the correct number of features?
- **Output**: Has the translation process restructured the data as expected?

> Features in the wrong source layer could need the whole process to be repeated. Data Inspection saves me that hassle.’

> 1. The color and linestyle of features
> 2. The number of features
> 3. The layers (classes, tables, types) 
> 4. Where the nearest coffee shop is
