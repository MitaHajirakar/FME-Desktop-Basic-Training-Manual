# Introduction to FME Workbench #
Let's take a look at what FME Workbench is and does.

## What is FME Workbench? ##
Workbench is FMEâ€™s tool for defining data translations and transformations.

It has an intuitive point-and-click interface to define flows of data graphically.

Workbench is fully integrated to interact with other FME Desktop applications such as the FME Data Inspector and other products such as *FME Server* and *FME Cloud*.

## Starting FME Workbench ##
Find FME Workbench in the FME Desktop sub-menu in the Windows start menu. Click on the entry to start Workbench.
