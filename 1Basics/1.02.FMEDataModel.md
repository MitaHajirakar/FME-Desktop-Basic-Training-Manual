## How FME Works ##
At the heart of FME is an engine that supports an array of data types and data formats; from GIS and CAD to BIM and Point Cloud, via XML, Raster, databases, and many more.


### Rich Data Model ###
The capability to support so many data types is made possible by a rich data model that handles all possible geometry and attribute types.

Most importantly, the data translation process is seamless to the user; FME automatically converts between data types as required, and automatically substitutes one attribute or geometry type for another where the destination format does not support it.
