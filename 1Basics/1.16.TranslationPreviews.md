# Translation Previews #

A key ability of FME is communication of data between Workbench and the FME Data Inspector.

 
## Redirect to FME Data Inspector ##
In some cases itâ€™s desirable to inspect output data, but undesirable to actually have to write the data to do so. In other words, you want to preview what the output of a translation will be.

For example, it would be useful to preview the results of a workspace that updates a spatial database. That way mistakes can be detected before writing to the database.

The Workbench tool to do this is the menu option Writers > Redirect to FME Data Inspector:

![](./Images/Img1.42.RedirectToDI.png)


When this setting is applied, the output from a translation is redirected away from the specified output and sent directly to FME Data Inspector instead.

This setting is a toggle, which means that each subsequent selection alternately turns the setting on and off.

An embarrassing problem occurs when a user forgets to deactivate the setting and does not understand why no output datasets are being written. To help combat this issue, the FME Log window includes a distinctive warning message when data is being redirected.
