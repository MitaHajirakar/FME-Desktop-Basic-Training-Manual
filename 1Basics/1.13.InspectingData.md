# Using the FME Data Inspector #

With the FME Data Inspector it’s easy to open and view any number of datasets and to query features within them.

 
## Viewing Data ##
The FME Data Inspector provides two methods for viewing data: opening or adding. Opening a dataset opens a new view window for it to be displayed in. Adding a dataset displays the data in the existing view window; this way multiple datasets can be viewed simultaneously.

## Opening a Dataset ##
Datasets can be opened in the FME Data Inspector in a number of ways.

- Selecting File > Open Dataset from the menu bar
- Selecting the toolbar button Open Dataset.
- Dragging and Dropping a file onto any window (except the View window)
- From within Workbench

Opening data from within FME Workbench is achieved by simply right-clicking on a canvas feature type (either source or destination) and choosing the option ‘Inspect.'

All of these methods cause a dialog to open in the FME Data Inspector in which to define the dataset to view.

## Adding a Dataset ##
Opening a dataset causes a new View tab to be created and the data displayed. To open a dataset within an existing view tab requires use of tools to add a dataset.

- Selecting File > Add Dataset from the menu bar
- Selecting the toolbar button Add Dataset
- Dragging and Dropping a file onto the view window

## Inspecting Data ##
Once data has been opened in the FME Data Inspector, there are a number of tools available for altering the view or querying features.

Windowing tools are:

- Pan
- Zoom In
- Zoom Out
- Zoom to a selected feature
- Zoom to the full extent of the data

Querying tools are

- Query individual feature(s)
- Measure a distance within a View window

By default the Query tool is active when you start the FME Data Inspector.

Clicking the toolbar Query button at this point only turns the tool off.

The results of a feature query are shown in the Feature Information window.

### Feature Information Window ###
The upper part reports on general information about the feature; which feature type (layer) it belongs to, which coordinate system it is in, whether it is two- or three-dimensional, and how many vertices it possesses.

The middle part reports the attributes associated with the feature. This includes user attributes and format attributes (for example fme_type).

The lower part reports the geometry of the feature. It includes the geometry type and a list of the coordinates that go to make up the feature.

### Table View Window ###
Also available is a window called the Table View.

The table view is a way to inspect data in a tabular, spreadsheet-like, layout. Although it does not have the same depth of information shown by the Information Window, the Table View is particularly useful for inspecting the attribute values of multiple features simultaneously.

## Background Maps ##
The ability to view maps (or other imagery) as a backdrop to your spatial data is activated by a tool under Tools > FME Options on the menubar.

The background map dialog lets the user select an existing dataset (of any FME-supported format) to use as a backdrop, like so:

It's also possible to use a number of different web services that supply mapping on demand. Some of these - such as ArcGIS Online - do require an existing account:

***Police Chief Webb-Mapp says....***

> When I'm investigating - sorry, inspecting - source data I know it must be referenced against a valid coordinate system for background data to be displayed. If the coordinate system is not recorded in the dataset itself, I can enter it into a field when opening the dataset

> I've also deduced that it doesn't matter what coordinate system the data is referenced against; FME will automatically convert it to whatever system is being used by the background map.
