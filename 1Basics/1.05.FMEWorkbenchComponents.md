# Major Components of FME Workbench #

The FME Workbench user interface has a number of major components:

## Menu/Toolbar ##
The menubar and toolbar contain a number of tools: for example, tools for navigating around the Workbench canvas, controlling administrative tasks, and adding or removing Reader (source) datasets.

## Canvas ##
The FME Workbench canvas is where users graphically define a translation. This definition is called a "workspace" and can be saved for re-use later.

By default the workspace reads from left to right; data source on the left, transformation tools in the center, and data destination on the right. Connections between each item represent the flow of data and may branch in different directions, merge together, or any combination of the two.

The canvas is the primary window within Workbench and the focus of all your work.

I'm the police chief for FME, and my word is law!  
<br><br>Let's make sure you get the terminology right. The application itself is called FME “Workbench”, but the process defined in the canvas window is called a “Workspace”. The terms are so similar that they are easily confused, but please don't, otherwise I will have to send my grammar squad to arrest you! 
<br><br>Although mistreating FME terminology is a minor offence the ignominy of being caught is long lasting!
