# Coordinate System Transformation #
To be located in a particular space on the Earth's surface the majority of spatial data is related to a particular coordinate system.


## Coordinate System Basics ##
Each feature that is processed by FME is coordinate system aware; that is, it knows what coordinate system it belongs to at all times. This helps prevent confusion when reading multiple datasets that belong to different coordinate systems.

Some users call this location of data a 'projection,' but projection is just one component of a definition within space. A true definition includes projection, datum, ellipsoid, units, and sometimes a quadrant, which together is called a 'Coordinate System.'
Coordinate System Settings

Each source reader and destination writer within FME is assigned a coordinate system. That coordinate system is set in the navigation pane of Workbench.

Here the source coordinate system has been defined as UTM83-10 and the destination as BCALB-83.

When a translation is carried out where the source and the destination coordinate systems differ in this way, FME automatically restructures the data, at the end of the translation, so that the output is in the correct location.

## Automatic Detection of Coordinate Systems ##
Some data formats are capable of containing information about the coordinate system in which they are held. Shape format is one example of this. FME can be set to detect any such information.

Because the source Reader coordinate system is marked
<not set>, FME will try to determine the coordinate system from the source dataset.

Because the destination Writer coordinate system is marked <not set>, FME will not reproject the data. Instead FME writes the data using the same coordinate system as the source data.
