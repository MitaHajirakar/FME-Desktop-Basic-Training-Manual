## Workspace Searching ##
The workspace search function is accessed through a hyperlink at the foot of the Navigator window:

Clicking this link opens up a text dialog in which to enter search terms. The results of the search include any attribute names, feature types, transformers, parameter names, and parameter values that include the search term entered.

Workspace search is important for debugging because sometimes the transformer that fails does so because of a fault in a completely different part of the workspace. When that happens, the ability to search a workspace for terms found in the error message helps to track down the source of the problem.

***TIP***
*Use a Workspace Search to locate items identified as problems in the log. This is especially useful when the workspace is very large.*
